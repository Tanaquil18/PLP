<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n, a\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Prove that if <m>n\mid a</m> and <m>n\mid (a+1)</m>, then <m>n=-1</m> or <m>n=1</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Think about the divisors of 1 and how you might use that.

<answer>
<p>
The hypothesis tells us that <m>a=nk</m> and <m>a+1=n\ell</m>. This means we can write <m>1 =  (a+1)-a = n\ell - nk = n(\ell-k)</m>. But this means <m>n \mid 1</m>. This is the basis of our proof.
</p>
</answer>
<solution>
<proof><p>
Let <m>n,a\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Assume that <m>n\mid a</m> and <m>n\mid (a+1)</m>. Then we see that <m>a=nk</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>(a+1)=n\ell</m> for some <m>\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, <m>1=(a+1)-a=n(\ell-k)</m> and since <m>(\ell-k)\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see <m>n\mid 1</m>. Therefore, since <m>n</m> is an integer, the only possibilities are that <m>n=1</m> or <m>n=-1</m>.
