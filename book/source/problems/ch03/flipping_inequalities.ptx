<statement>
<p>
Consider the faulty proof below for the following statement:
</p>

<p>
Let <m>x</m> be a negative real number. Show that <m>-1 \lt \dfrac{5}{3x-5}</m>.
</p>

<proof><title>Faulty proof</title>
<p>
Let <m>x</m> be negative. Then by multiplying the inequality
<me> -1 \lt \dfrac{5}{3x-5} </me>
by <m>3x-5</m> we obtain
<me> -3x+5 \lt 5 . </me>
and therefore <m>-3x \lt 0</m>. Dividing by <m>-3</m> we end up with <m>x \lt 0</m>, which is true.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
Identify any issues with the proof as written above, and then give a correct proof of the statement.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
There are a number of issues with this proof.
First, it is written in the wrong order <mdash/> we start with the conclusion of the implication, and end up with the hypothesis of the implication.
Also, there are two times that we divide by a negative number but fail to flip the sign of the inequality. This happens when we divide by
<m>3x-5</m>, which is negative since <m>x \lt 0</m>, and when we divide by <m>-3</m>.
Notice that since this happens twice, we end up with the right inequality (by luck!), but the proof is still incorrect since we took the wrong path to this inequality.
</p>
<p>
Here's a correct proof of the statement:
</p>

<proof><p>
Let <m>x \lt 0</m>. Multiplying by <m>-3</m>, we have <m>-3x \gt 0</m>, and so <m>-3x+5 \gt 5</m>. Writing this as
<me> -(3x-5) \gt 5 </me>
we divide through by <m>3x-5</m>, which is negative as <m>x \lt 0</m>, and obtain
<me> -1 \lt \dfrac{5}{3x-5}. </me>
</p>

</proof>
