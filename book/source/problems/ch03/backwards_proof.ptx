<statement>
<p>
Consider the faulty proof below for the following statement:
</p>
<p>
Let <m>x</m> be a positive real number. If <m>x \lt 1</m>, then <m>1 \lt \dfrac{3x+2}{5x}</m>.
</p>

<proof><title>Faulty proof</title>
<p>
Let <m>x</m> be positive. Then by multiplying the inequality
<me> 1 \lt \frac{3x+2}{5x} </me>
by <m>5x</m>, which is positive, we obtain
<me> 5x \lt 3x+2 . </me>
Collecting like terms, we have <m>2x \lt 2</m>, and finally dividing by <m>2</m>, we have <m>x \lt 1</m>.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
Identify any issues with the proof as written above, and then give a correct proof of the statement.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The issue with the proof is that it is written in the wrong order <mdash/> we start with the conclusion of the implication, and end up with the hypothesis of the implication.
Essentially, the proof is backwards. Often, when doing scratch work for proofs involving inequalities, you will end up with a backwards proof. However, when you're writing up the proof formally, always remember to start off with the hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
Here's a correct proof of the statement:
</p>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>x</m> be positive.
Assume that <m>x \lt 1</m>.
Then <m>2x \lt 2</m>, and so <m>5x \lt 3x+2</m>.
Since <m>x \gt 0</m>, we can divide this inequality by <m>5x</m> to obtain
<me> 1 \lt \frac{3x+2}{5x}</me>
which is the desired inequality.
</p>
</proof>
