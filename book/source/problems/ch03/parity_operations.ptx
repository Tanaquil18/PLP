We have already seen a proof that the product of two odd numbers is also odd.
We'll now look at the remaining cases for the parity of a product or sum of two integers.
</p>
<p>
For each of the following cases, determine if the resulting number is even or odd, and prove your statement:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 the sum of two odd numbers;
</p></li>
<li>
<p>

</p></li>

 the sum of an even and an odd number;
</p></li>
<li>

 the product of two even numbers;

Let's consider the first case: the sum of two odd numbers. We're trying to determine the parity of <m>m+n</m>, where both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are odd.
Since they're both odd, we know that <m>m=2k+1</m> and <m>n=2\ell+1</m> for some integers <m>k,\ell</m>. Then we can write
<me> m+n = (2k+1)+(2\ell+1)=2k+2\ell+2. </me>
We want to write <m>m+n</m> in either the form <m>2p</m> or <m>2p+1</m> for some integer <m>p</m>, which is possible depending on whether or not there is a factor of <m>2</m> in <m>m+n</m>, respectively.
In this case, we can factor out a <m>2</m>:
<me> m+n = 2(k+\ell+1) </me>
and so <m>m+n</m> is even. Note also that here we use the fact that <m>k+\ell+1</m> is an integer, since both <m>k</m> and <m>\ell</m> are integers.

With this scratch work we can write a formal proof to the statement, <q>the sum of two odd numbers is even.</q>
The solutions to the remaining parts can be determined using the same logic: first, we'll suppose that <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are two integers whose parity is given.
We can then write out <m>m</m> in the form <m>2k</m> if its even, or <m>2k+1</m> if its odd, and similarly for <m>n</m> (although we should be careful not to reuse the variable <m>k</m> in our expression for <m>n</m>). Using these expressions we can then obtain an expression for <m>m+n</m> or <m>mn</m>.
Then we manipulate this expression so that it's either in the form <m>2p</m> or <m>2p+1</m>, where <m>p</m> is an integer, to determine if it is even or odd.

<li>
<p>
 The sum of two odd numbers is even.
</p>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>m,n</m> be two odd numbers. Then there are some <m>k,\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>m=2k+1</m> and <m>n=2\ell+1</m>, and so
<me> m+n = (2k+1)+(2\ell+1) =2(k+\ell+1). </me>
Since <m>k,\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we also have that <m>k+\ell+1</m> is an integer, and thus <m>m+n</m> is even.
