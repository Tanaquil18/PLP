<statement>
<p>
The <em>floor</em> function, denoted by <m>\lfloor x \rfloor </m>, is defined to be the function that takes a real number <m>x</m> and returns the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>. This is also sometimes called the <em>greatest integer function</em>. For example,
<me>
\lfloor 3.5 \rfloor=3,
\qquad
\lfloor -2.5 \rfloor=-3,
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\lfloor 7 \rfloor=7.
</me>
Using this definition, prove that
<me>
\lfloor x \rfloor=x
\implies
x\in\mathbb{Z}</me>,
and that
<me>
x\in\mathbb{Z}
\implies
  \lfloor x \rfloor=x.
</me>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>

<proof><p>
We prove each implication in turn.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Assume that <m> \lfloor x \rfloor=x</m>. Then, since the floor function, by definition, returns an integer, we see that <m>x= \lfloor x \rfloor \in \mathbb{Z}</m> as required.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Now assume that <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, since the floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>, we know that <m>\lfloor x \rfloor \leq x</m>. Additionally, since <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>x \leq x</m>, we know that <m>x</m> is an integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>. Now <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m> is the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>, so we must have that <m>x \leq \lfloor x \rfloor</m>. Because
<m>x \leq \lfloor x \rfloor</m> and <m>x \geq \lfloor x \rfloor</m>, we know <m>x = \lfloor x \rfloor</m>.
  </p></li>
</ul>
</p></proof>
<p>
  What we are really doing here is proving a <q>biconditional statement</q>. We will see much more on this in the next couple of chapters.
