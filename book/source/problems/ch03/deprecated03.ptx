  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>n</m> is even then <m>n^2+3n+5</m> is odd.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume <m>n</m> is even. Then we know <m>n=2k</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
        Hence, <m>n^2+3n+5=(2k)^2+3(2k)+5=2(2k^2+3k+2)+1</m>.
        Since <m>2k^2+3k+2\in\mathbb{Z}</m> for <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see  <m>n^2+3n+5</m> is odd.

  <statement>
    <p>
      The product of two odd numbers is odd.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>n,m</m> are odd integers. Then we know <m>n=2k+1</m> and
      <m>m=2l+1</m> for some <m>k,l\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, <m>nm=(2k+1)(2l+1)=2(2kl+k+l)+1</m>. Therefore, since <m>2kl+k+l\in\mathbb{Z}</m> for <m>k,l\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see <m>nm</m> is odd.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>n,a,b,x,y\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. If <m>n\mid a</m> and <m>n\mid b</m>, then <m>n\mid (ax+by)</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>n,a,b,x,y\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>n\mid a</m>, and <m>n\mid b</m>.
      This implies that <m>a=nk</m> and <m>b=nl</m> for some <m>k,l\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
      Thus, <m>ax+by=nkx+nly=n(kx+ly)</m>. Since <m>kx+ly\in\mathbb{Z}</m> for <m>k,x,l,y\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, then we see <m>n\mid (ax+by)</m>.
    </p>
    </proof>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. If <m>3\mid (n-4)</m>, then <m>3\mid (n^2-1)</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>3\mid (n-4)</m>.
      Then we see that <m>(n-4)=3k</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
      Thus, <m>n=3k+4</m>, which implies <m>n^2-1= (3k+4)^2-1=(9k^2+24k+16)-1= 3(3k^2+8k+5)</m>. Therefore, since <m>3k^2+8k+5\in\mathbb{Z}</m> for <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see <m>3\mid (n^2-1)</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>a\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. If <m>3\mid a</m> and <m>2\mid a</m>, then <m>6\mid a</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Let <m>a\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
      Assume that <m>2\mid a</m> and <m>3\mid a</m>.
      This implies <m>a=2k</m>for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>a=3m</m> for some <m>m\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
      Thus, we see <m>3a=6k</m> and <m>2a=6m</m>.
      Hence, <m>a=3a-2a=6k-6m=6(k-m)</m>, and therefore, since <m>(k-m)\in\mathbb{Z}</m> for <m>k,l\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see tjat <m>6\mid a</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>

<exercise>
  <statement>
      <p>Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>a,b \gt 0</m>. Prove that
      <me>
        a \lt b \qquad \implies \qquad a^2 \lt b^2
      </me>
      Also prove that the converse holds.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>0 \gt a \leq b</m>. Since <m>a,b</m> are both positive we can multiply these this inequality by both and preserve the sign of the inequality, giving:
      <me>
        a^2 \leq ab \qquad \text{ and } ab \leq b^2
      </me>
      Putting these together we get <m>a^2 \leq ab \leq b^2</m> as required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume that <m>a^2 \leq b^2</m>. Rearrange this to get
      <me>
        0 \leq b^2 - a^2 = (b-a)(b+a)
      </me>
      Since <m>a,b \gt 0</m> we know that <m>b+a\gt 0</m> and so we can divide both sides of the inequality by that to get
      <me>
        \frac{0}{b+a} = 0  \leq (b-a)
      </me>
      Hence we must have <m>a \leq b</m> as required.
    </p>
  </solution>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>. If <m>x \lt 0</m> then <m>x + \frac{1}{x} \lt -1</m>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint><p>Try multiplying the inequality in the conclusion by <m>x</m>.</p></hint>
  <answer>
    <proof>
      <p>Let <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m>, and assume that <m>x\lt 0</m>. Then
      <me>
        (x+1)^2 \geq 0
      </me>
      and so
      <me>
        (x+1)^2 \gt x
      </me>
      Expanding this gives
      <md>
        <mrow>x^2+2x+1 \amp\gt x \amp \text{ and so}</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2 +1 \amp \gt -x </mrow>
      </md>
      Dividing both sides by <m>x</m> gives (since <m>x\lt 0</m>)
      <me>
        x + \frac{1}{x} \lt -1
      </me>
      as required.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We assume that <m>x \lt 0</m>. Then the conclusion is
    <me>
      x+\frac{1}{x} \lt -1.
    </me>
    As per the hint, multiply this by <m>x</m> (remembering that <m>x</m> is negative, so the inequality switches around):
    <me>
      x^2 + 1 \gt -x
    </me>
    or equivalently
    <me>
      x^2 + x +1 \gt 0
    </me>
    We should try to make this look like a square. We can do this by adding <m>x</m> to both sides:
    <me>
      x^2+2x+1 \gt x.
    </me>
    This is
    <me>
      (x+1)^2 \gt x
    </me>
    We know that a square is always non-negative, so
    <me>
      (x+1)^2 \geq 0
    </me>
    and we also know that <m>0 \gt x</m> and so we are done. Well <mdash /> except that our scratchwork is backwards.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Recall that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          <em>The Mean Value Theorem</em> states that if we have a function <m>f</m> which is continuous in the interval <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable in <m>(a,b)</m>, then whenever <m>x_1,x_2\in[a,b]</m> and <m>x_1\neq x_2</m>, we have a point <m>c\in(x_1,x_2)</m> such that
          <me> f(x_2)-f(x_1) = f'(c) (x_2-x_1)</me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> a function, <m>g</m>, is <em>strictly increasing</em> if whenever we have <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m> we also have <m>g(x_1) \lt g(x_2)</m>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Use The Mean Value Theorem to show that if <m>f</m> is a differentiable function and the derivative of <m>f</m> is positive everywhere, then <m>f</m> is a strictly increasing function.
    </p>

  </statement>
  <answer>
    <proof>
      <p>
      Assume that <m>f</m> is a differentiable function and its derivative is positive everywhere. Also assume that <m>x_1, x_2\in\mathbb{R}</m> and <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
       By <em>The Mean Value Theorem</em>, we know that <m>f(x_2)-f(x_1) = f'(c)(x_2-x_1)</m> for some <m>c\in(x_1,x_2)</m>. Since the derivative is positive everywhere, we know that <m>f'(c) \gt 0</m>, and since <m>x_2 \gt x_1</m> we also know that <m>(x_2-x_1)\gt 0</m>. Hence <m>f(x_2)-f(x_1) = f'(c)(x_2-x_1) \gt 0 </m> and <m>f(x_2)\gt f(x_1)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>Therefore <m>f</m> is a strictly increasing function.</p>
      </proof>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      <alert>Definition:</alert> We call a number <m>n</m> an <term>integer root</term> when  <m>n^k=m</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{N}</m> and <m>m \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>Use this definition to show that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integer roots, then so is <m>ab</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>Notice that every integer <m>t</m> is an integer root since we can take <m>k=1</m> and <m>m=t</m> as given in the definition. But an integer root does not have to be an integer, since numbers such as <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is an integer root; take <m>k=3</m> and <m>m=7</m> as given in the definition.
    </p>
  </hint>
  <answer>
    <proof>
      <p>Assume that <m>a, b</m> are integer roots, then, by definition, there are natural numbers <m>k,l</m> and integers <m>m,s</m> such that <m>a^k=n</m> and <m>b^l=m</m>.
      Therefore we see that <m>(ab)^{kl}=n^lm^k</m>.
      Since <m>kl\in\mathbb{N}</m> and <m>n^lm^k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, we see that <m>ab</m> is also an integer root.
