<statement>
<p>
Consider the faulty proof below for the following statement:
</p>
<p>
Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be integers. If <m>a\mid b</m> and <m>b\mid c</m>, then <m>a\mid c</m>.
</p>

<proof><title>Faulty proof</title>
<p>
Assume <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are integers such that <m>a\mid b</m> and <m>b\mid c</m>.
Since <m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>, we have that <m>b=ka</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
Moreover, since <m>b</m> divides <m>c</m>, we have that <m>c=kb</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
But then
<me> c=k(ka)=k^2a, </me>
Since <m>k</m> is an integer, <m>k^2\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, and it follows that <m>a</m> divides <m>c</m>.
</p>
</proof>



<p>
Identify any issues with the proof as written above, and then give a correct proof of the statement.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The issue with this proof is that we used the variable <m>k</m> in two different situations. In general, the integer multiple that <m>b</m> is of <m>a</m> would be different than the integer multiple that <m>c</m> is of <m>b</m>.
While the logic of the proof is mostly correct, we end up with the statement <m>c=k^2a</m> (that <m>c</m> is a square multiple of <m>a</m>), which is incorrect.
For example, if <m>a</m> is positive while <m>c</m> is negative, then we definitely can't find an integer <m>k</m> satisfying <m>c=k^2a</m>.
</p>
<p>
Let's rewrite the proof with these issues resolved:
</p>

<proof><p>
Assume <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are integers such that <m>a\mid b</m> and <m>b\mid c</m>.
Since <m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>, we have that <m>b=ka</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
Moreover, since <m>b</m> divides <m>c</m>, we have that <m>c=\ell b</m> for some <m>\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
But then
<me> c=k(\ell a)=(k\ell)a, </me>
Since <m>k</m> and <m>\ell</m> are integers, <m>k\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, and it follows that <m>a</m> divides <m>c</m>.
</p></proof>
