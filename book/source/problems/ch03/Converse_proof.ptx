<statement>
<p>
Consider the faulty proof below for the following statement:
</p>
<p>
<md>
<mrow>
  \text{Show that if } x+y \text{ is odd, then either } x \text{ or } y \text{ is odd, but not both}.
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<proof><title>Faulty proof</title>
<p>
Assume that either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd, but not both. Assume that <m>x</m> is odd and <m>y</m> is even (otherwise, switch <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the following argument). By the definitions of odd and even numbers, we know that <m>x=2n+1</m> and <m>y=2m</m> for some <m>n,m \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then
<me>x + y = (2n+1) + (2m)=2 (n+m) + 1.</me>
Since <m>n, m \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and the sum of integers is also an integer, we see that <m>n+m\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, so that <m>x+y</m> fits the definition of an odd number.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
Identify any issues with the proof as written above.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
We have accidentally proven the converse rather than the desired statement. We started by assuming the conclusion, and ended up showing that the hypothesis is true. A correct proof can be given by using cases or proving the contrapositive <xref ref="ch-moreproof"/>.
