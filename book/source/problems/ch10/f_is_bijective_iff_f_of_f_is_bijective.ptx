 You may need to show that if <m>f\circ g</m> is injective then <m>g</m> is injective, and then show that if <m>f\circ g</m> is surjective then <m>f</m> is surjective.

 Combining part (a) with <xref ref="thm_comp_inj_surj"/>, we know that <m>f</m> is bijective if and only if <m>f\circ f</m> is bijective.

  <proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
 <p>
Assume <m>f\circ f</m> is bijective. Let <m>x,y\in A</m> and assume that <m>f(x)=f(y)</m>. Then, since <m>f</m> is a function, we get <m>(f\circ f)(x)=(f\circ f)(y)</m>. Moreover, since <m>f\circ f</m> is injective we see <m>x=y</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is injective.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, if <m>b\in A</m>, then we see that since <m>f\circ f</m> is surjective, there exists <m>a\in A</m> such that <m>(f\circ f)(a)=b</m>. Thus, we see that <m>f(f(a))=b</m>, which means that for <m>c=f(a)\in A</m>, we have <m>f(c)=b</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.
</p>
<p>
Hence, <m>f</m> is bijective.

We see that if <m>f(x)=\log\left( \dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1} \right)</m>, then
<md>
<mrow>
f\circ f(x) \amp =f(f(x))
</mrow>
<intertext>Using the definition of <m>f</m> for the <q>inner</q> function,</intertext>
<mrow>
 \amp =f\left( \log\left( \dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1} \right) \right)
</mrow>
<intertext>Using the definition of <m>f</m> for the <q>outer</q> function,</intertext>
<mrow>
 \amp =\log\left( \dfrac{e^{\log\left( \dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1} \right)}+1}{e^{\log\left( \dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1} \right)}-1} \right)
</mrow>
<intertext>We now use the fact that <m>e</m> and <m>\log</m> are inverse functions to obtain,</intertext>
<mrow>
 \amp =\log\left( \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1}\right)+1}{ \left(\dfrac{e^x+1}{e^x-1}\right)-1} \right)
 </mrow>
<intertext>Simplifying, we see</intertext>
<mrow>
 \amp = \log \left(\dfrac{ \left(\dfrac{2e^x}{e^x-1} \right)}{ \left(\dfrac{2}{e^x-1}\right) }\right)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =\log(e^x)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =x.
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we see that <m>f\circ f</m> is the identity function, <m>i_{(0,\infty)}</m>. And then by part<nbsp/>(a), since <m>i_{(0,\infty)}</m> is bijective, <m>f</m> is bijective.
