<statement>
<p>
  For <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, let <m>A=\{ a_1, a_2, a_3,\cdots, a_n \}</m> be a fixed set where <m>a_j\neq a_i</m> for any <m>i\neq j</m>, and let <m>F</m> be the set of all functions <m>f: A\rightarrow \{ 0,1 \}</m>.
</p>
<p>
  What is <m>|F|</m>, the cardinality of <m>F</m>?
</p>
<p>
Now, for <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m>, the power set of <m>A</m>, consider the function <m>g:F \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)</m>, defined as
<me>
g(f)=\{ a\in A: f(a)=1 \}.
</me>
Is <m>g</m> injective? Is <m>g</m> surjective?
</p>
</statement>

<p>
 You can start the problem with a small set, say <m>A=\set{1,2,3}</m>, to understand the set <m>F</m> and the function <m>g</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 To find <m>|F|</m>, think about how many different images there are there for each element in <m>A</m>.

<solution>

  <proof><title>Proof of cardinality of <m>F</m></title>
    <p> We see that for <m>f:A\rightarrow \set{0,1}</m> to be a function, every element in <m>A</m> has to go to a unique element in <m>\set{0,1}</m>. Then we see that for every element <m>a_i</m>, <m>i\in\set{1,2,\cdots, n}</m>, there are two different options for the value of <m>f(a_i)</m>, <m>f(a_i)=0</m> or <m>f(a_i)=1</m>. Thus, there are <m>2^n</m> diffferent ways we can construct a function from <m>A</m> to  <m>\set{0,1}</m>. Therefore, <m>|F|=2^n</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <proof><title>Proof that <m>g</m> is injective and surjective</title>
<p>
Now, let <m>g:F \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)</m> be defined as <m>g(f)=\{ a\in A: f(a)=1 \}</m>. We prove show that this function is both surjective and injective.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Surjective: Let <m>B\in\mathcal P(A)</m>. Then, we see that <m>B\subseteq A</m>. Thus, we can define <m>f_B: A\rightarrow \set{0,1}</m>, defined as <m>f_B(x)=1</m> if <m>x\in B</m> and <m>f_B(x)=0</m>  if <m>x\notin B</m>. Then we see that <m>f_B</m> is well-defined and moreover, we have <m>g(f_B)=B</m>. Therefore, <m>g</m> is surjective.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Injective: Let <m>f_1,f_2\in F</m> and assume that <m>g(f_1)=g(f_2)</m>. This implies,
<me>
\set{a\in A: f_1(a)=1}=\set{a\in A: f_2(a)=1}.
</me>
Call this set <m>B</m>. To show that <m>f_1=f_2</m>, we show that the functions agree at all inputs. Let <m>x \in A</m>, then either <m>x \in B</m> or <m>x \not\in B</m>. When <m>x=\in B</m>, we have, by definition of <m>B</m>, <m>f_1(x)=1=f_2(x)</m>. Then when <m>x \not\in B</m> we have <m>f_1(x)=0=f_2(x)</m>.Therefore <m>\forall x\in A</m>, we have <m>f_1(x)=f_2(x)</m>, which implies <m>f_1=f_2</m>. Therefore <m>g</m> is injective.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p></proof>


<p>
Notice that we can also prove the injectiveness of <m>g</m> as follows:
</p>

<proof><title>Alternative proof that <m>g</m> is injective</title>
  <p>
  Let <m>f_1, f_2 \in F</m> so that <m>f_1 \neq f_2</m>. This means that there is some <m>x \in A</m>  so that <m>f_1(x) \neq f_2(x)</m>. Now, either <m>f_1(x)=0</m>, or <m>f_1(x)= 1</m>.
  <ul>
<li>
<p>
 Assume <m>f_1(x) = 1</m> and so <m>f_2(x)=0</m>. Then <m>x \in g(f_1)</m> but <m>x \not\in g(f_2)</m>, and so <m>g(f_1) \neq g(f_2)</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Similarly, when <m>f_1(x)=0</m> we know <m>f_2(x)=1</m>. Hence <m>x \not\in g(f_1)</m> but <m>x \in g(f_2)</m>, and again <m>g(f_1) \neq g(f_2)</m>
  </p></li>
</ul>
  Thus when <m>f_1 \neq f_2</m> we know that <m>g(f_1) \neq g(f_2)</m> and thus <m>g</m> is injective.
</p></proof>
