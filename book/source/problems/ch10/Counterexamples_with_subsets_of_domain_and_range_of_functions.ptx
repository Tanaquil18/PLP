<statement>
<p>
Find counterexamples to the following statements:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 Given a function <m>f : A\rightarrow B</m> and subsets <m>W,X \subseteq A</m>, we have <m>f (W\cap X) = f (W)\cap f (X)</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Given a function <m>f : A \rightarrow B</m> and a subset <m>Y \subseteq B</m>, we have <m>f ( f^{-1}(Y)) = Y</m>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
Explain your answers.

Try to construct counterexamples on small sets (eg. <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>) rather than on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.

 We will try to construct a function <m>f</m> and sets <m>X,W</m> such that <m>f(W\cap X)</m> has few elements, but <m>f(W)</m> and <m>f(X)</m> have many elements in common. One way of accomplishing this is to make <m>W\cap X</m> small (for example, having only one element in common), but designing the function <m>f</m> to produce the same output for distinct elements of <m>X</m> and <m>W</m>.

    As a counterexample, take <m>f:\set{-1,0,1}\rightarrow \set{0,1}</m> defined as <m>f(x)=|x|</m> and consider the subsets <m>W=\set{-1,0}</m> and <m>X\set{0,1}</m>. Then we see <m>f (W\cap X)=f(\set{0})=\set{0}</m> and <m>f(W)=f(X)=\set{0,1}</m>. Hence <m>f (W\cap X) =\set{0}\neq \set{0,1}= f (W)\cap f (X)</m>.

 Recall from <xref ref="thm_img_preimg"/>(ii), <m>f(f^{-1}(Y))\subseteq Y</m> for any <m>Y\subseteq B</m>. Therefore we need to find an example where <m>Y</m> is not a subset of <m>f(f^{-1}(Y))</m>. This means that we need to find a function that is not surjective, i.e. not every element of Y is in the range of the function.

<p>
    As a counterexample, we take <m>f:\set{1,2}\rightarrow\set{1,2,3}</m>, defined as <m>f(x)=x</m> and let  <m>Y=\set{2,3}</m>. Notice that there is no element in the domain that maps to <m>3</m>, so <m>f</m> fails to be surjective.

  <proof><title>Disproof of (a)</title>
  <p>
As a counterexample, take <m>f:\set{-1,0,1}\rightarrow \set{0,1}</m> defined as <m>f(x)=|x|</m> and consider the subsets <m>W=\set{-1,0}</m> and <m>X\set{0,1}</m>. Then we see <m>f (W\cap X)=f(\set{0})=\set{0}</m> and <m>f(W)=f(X)=\set{0,1}</m>. Hence <m>f (W\cap X) =\set{0}\neq \set{0,1}= f (W)\cap f (X)</m>. Thus the statement is false.

<p>
As a counterexample, take <m>f:\set{1,2}\rightarrow\set{1,2,3}</m>, defined as <m>f(x)=x</m> and let  <m>Y=\set{2,3}</m>. Then we see that <m>f^{-1}(Y)=\set{2}</m>, which implies  <m>f ( f^{-1}(Y)) =\set{2}\neq \set{2,3}= Y</m>. Hence the statement is false.
