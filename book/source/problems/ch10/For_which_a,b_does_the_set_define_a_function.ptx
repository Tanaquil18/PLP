<statement>
<p>
For which values of <m>a,b\in\mathbb N</m> does the set
<m>\phi=\set{(x,y)\in\mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z: ax+by= 6 }</m> define a function?
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Remember that a function has to give a valid output for every valid input <mdash/> why does this tell you about the <m>y</m>-values?
</p>
</hint>
<answer>
<p>
Let us start by rearranging things a little. We must have <m>ax+by=6</m> which means that
<me>
  y = \frac{6-ax}{b}.
</me>
So for any given <m>x</m> there is only a single value of <m>y</m>.
</p>
<p>
But we also require that <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, which means that we must have
<me>
  b \mid (6-ax)
</me>
for every <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Setting <m>x=0</m> immediately tells us that <m>b \mid 6</m>, and so <m>b \in \set{1,2,3,6}</m>.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 When <m>b=1</m>, then <m>y=6-ax \in \mathbb{Z}</m> for any <m>a \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 When <m>b=2</m>, then <m>y=\frac{6-ax}{2} = 3-\frac{ax}{2}</m> will be an integer for all <m>x</m> provided <m>2 \mid a</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 When <m>b=3</m>, then <m>y=\frac{6-ax}{3} = 2-\frac{ax}{3}</m> will be an integer for all <m>x</m> provided <m>3 \mid a</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 And finally, when <m>b=3</m>, then <m>y=\frac{6-ax}{6} = 1-\frac{ax}{6}</m> will be an integer for all <m>x</m> provided <m>6 \mid a</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
That is, <m>\phi</m> is a function provided <m>b \in \set{1,2,3,6}</m> (that is <m>b \mid 6</m>) and <m>b \mid a</m>.
</p>

<p>
  Now, strictly speaking we have shown that if <m>\phi</m> is a function, then we have <m>b \mid 6, b\mid a</m>. We can also readily show that when <m>b \mid 6, b \mid a</m> then <m>\phi</m> is a function. 
</p>
<p>
  So now assume that <m>b \mid 6, b \mid a</m>, and sot <m>6=kb, a=\ell b</m> for integers <m>k,\ell</m>. Hence
  <me>
    y = \frac{6-ax}{b} = \frac{kb - \ell b x}{b} = k-\ell x
  </me>
  and thus if <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> then <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, and so we have a function.
</p>

</answer>
<solution>
<p>
<em>Claim:</em> <m>\phi</m> is a function for all <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}</m> satisfying  <m>b \mid 6</m> and <m>b \mid a</m>.
</p>

<proof><p>
For <m>\phi</m> to define a function <m>\forall x\in \mathbb Z</m>, there has to be a unique point <m>y\in\mathbb Z</m> such that <m>(x,y)\in\phi</m>. Let <m>x\in\mathbb Z</m>. Then, by definition of <m>\phi</m>, we see that <m>y=\dfrac{6-ax}{b}</m>, which is uniquely defined for any <m>x\in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Then, we see that for <m>\phi</m> to be a function, <m>\dfrac{6-ax}{b}</m> must be an integer.
</p>
<p>
Since this has to be true for any <m>x\in \mathbb Z</m>, we see that it has to be true for <m>x=0</m>, so <m>b\mid 6</m>. Thus, <m>b\in\set{1,2,3,6}</m>.
</p>
<p>
This also means that for <m>\phi</m> for be a function <m>\dfrac{ax}{b}</m> must also be an integer, that is <m>b \mid ax</m>. Setting <m>x=1</m> tells us that <m>a</m> must be a multiple of <m>b</m> as claimed.
</p>

<p>
  Now assume that <m>b \mid 6</m> and <m>b \mid a</m>, so that <m>6 =
  b k, a = b \ell</m> for some <m>k,\ell \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Notice
  that <m>k \neq 0</m>. Then the condition that <m>ax+by=6</m> becomes
  <me>
    \ell b x + b y = b k
  </me>
  and dividing through by <m>k</m> we have
  <me>
    \ell x + y = k
  </me>
  or <m>y=k-\ell x</m>. Then for any <m>x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> we know that <m>y \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and so <m>\phi</m> is a function.
