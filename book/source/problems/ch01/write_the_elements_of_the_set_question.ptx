<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 <m>A_1</m> is the set of all natural numbers whose square is less than <m>2</m>. We see that there is only one natural number satisfying that condition, which is <m>1</m>.
</p>
<p>
Thus, <m>A_1=\set{1}</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
  We see that this set looks very similar to <m>A_1</m>. But we see that it is differrent in that we now are looking at the set of all <em>integers</em> whose square is less than <m>2</m>, not natural numbers. In this case, we see that we have <m>3</m> numbers satisfying the condition, namely <m>-1</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>1</m>.
</p>
<p>
Thus, <m>A_2=\set{-1,0,1}</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>A_3</m> is the set of all natural numbers that are multiples of <m>3</m> and also divisors of <m>216</m>.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, <m>A_3=\set{ 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 27, 36, 54, 72, 108, 216}</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>A_4</m> is the set of all integers <m>x</m> such that if we add <m>2</m> and divide the result by <m>5</m> we still get an integer
</p>
<p>
So, we see that <m>A_4=\set{\ldots, -12, -7, -2, 3,  8, 13, \ldots}</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We see that <m>A_5</m> is the set of all elements <m>a</m> in <m>B</m> such that <m>6\leq 4a+1 \lt 1</m>. So, all we need to do is to check which elements of <m>B</m> satisfy this condition.
</p>
<p>
Then, we see <m>A_5=\set{2,3}</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We see that the set <m>A_6</m> is the set of all elements of <m>B</m> whose product with at least one element of <m>D</m> is between <m>50</m> and <m>100</m>, exclusive. So, to find the elements of <m>A_6</m>, we need to calculate the products of elements of <m>B</m> with elements of <m>D</m>.
</p>
<p>
Once we calculate that we see, <m>A_6=\set{7,11,13,17,19}</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>A_7</m> is the set of all integers <m>n</m> satisfying the inequality <m>n^2-5n-16\leq n</m>, or in other words, <m>n^2-6n-16\leq 0</m>. If we factor the expression on the left, we see that we want to find the integers satisfying <m>(n+2)(n-8)\leq 0</m>. Then, we see that for this inequality to be valid, we need to have <m>n\in[-2,8]</m>.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, <m>A_7=\set{-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 }</m>.
