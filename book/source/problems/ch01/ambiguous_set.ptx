<statement>
<p>
Consider the following ill-defined set: <m>S=\set{2, 4,\dots}</m>.
Show that the definition of <m>S</m> is ambiguous by providing two different ways that you could interpret its definition.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The set is ill-defined because we haven't written out enough elements to determine the set's <q>rule</q>.
We could, for example, interpret this set as the set of all positive even integers,
<me> \set{2, 4, 6, 8,\dots}, </me>
or the the set of all positive integer powers of two,
<me> \set{2, 4, 8, 16,\dots}. </me>
</p>
</solution>
