<statement>
<p>
Show that each of the numbers
<me> a=2, \qquad b=8, \qquad \text{and} \qquad c=-12 </me>
do not belong to any of the following sets:
<md>
<mrow>
A \amp =\set{-\frac{1}{n}\st n\in\mathbb{N}} \amp  \;  \amp B=\set{x\in\mathbb{R} \st x\geq0, \; x^2 \gt 100} 
</mrow><mrow>
C \amp =\set{\{2\}, \{8\}, \{-12\}} \amp  \;  \amp D=\set{4k\st k\in\mathbb{N}, \; k \text{ odd}}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 The only integer that belongs to <m>A</m> is <m>-1</m>, so all of the numbers listed are not elements of <m>A</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The numbers <m>2</m> and <m>8</m> do not belong to <m>B</m> because their squares do not exceed 100; <m>-12</m> is not an element of <m>B</m> because it is negative.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The elements of <m>C</m> are the set containing <m>2</m>, the set containing <m>8</m>, and the set containing <m>-12</m>. <m>C</m> itself does not actually have the elements <m>2</m>, <m>8</m>, and <m>-12</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The number <m>2</m> does not belong to <m>D</m> because it is not a multiple of <m>4</m>,  <m>8</m> does not belong to <m>D</m> because it is not an <em>odd</em> multiple of <m>4</m>, and <m>-12</m> does not belong to <m>D</m> because it is not a <em>positive</em> multiple of <m>4</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
</solution>
