<statement>
<p>
Let <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m>. Show that if <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m>, then <m>|2x^2-3x-2| \lt 3</m>.  You may use the following result without proof:
<me> |ab|=|a|\cdot|b| \text{ for any } a,b\in\mathbb{R}. </me>
</p>
</statement>


<answer>
<p>
In order to bound <m>|2x^2-3x-2|</m>, we can factor the expression, and try to bound each term.
<me> |2x^2-3x-2|=|(2x+1)(x-2)|=|2x+1|\cdot|x-2| </me>
The factor <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m>, by assumption. But how can we bound the factor <m>|2x+1|</m>? We'll need to use the inequality <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m> again.
</p>
<p>
Recall that <m>|x-2| \lt 1 </m> is equivalent to the inequality
<me> -1 \lt x-2 \lt 1.  </me>
Adding <m>2</m> to everything, we end up with
<me> 1 \lt x \lt 3 </me>
which implies that <m>|x| \lt 3</m>. Now we can use the triangle inequality to bound <m>|2x+1|</m>:
<me> |2x+1|\leq |2x|+1=2|x|+1 \lt 2\cdot3+1=7. </me>
</p>

<p>
With this scrap work, we're ready to write up the proof of the statement.
But remember, we have to make sure that our logic flows in the correct direction. We must make sure our proof starts from the hypothesis, <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m>, and ends at the conclusion, <m>|2x^2-3x-2| \lt 3</m>.
</p>
</answer>

<solution>
<proof>
<p>
Let <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m>, and suppose that <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m>.
Note that this inequality implies that
<me> -1 \lt x-2 \lt 1.  </me>
Adding <m>2</m> to everything, we end up with
<me> 1 \lt x \lt 3 </me>
which implies that <m>|x| \lt 3</m>.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, note that
<me> |2x^2-3x-2|=|(2x+1)(x-2)|=|2x+1|\cdot|x-2|. </me>
Using the inequality <m>|x-2| \lt 1</m>, we therefore have
<me> |2x^2-3x-2| \lt |2x+1|\cdot1. </me>
However, using the triangle inequality, and the bound <m>|x| \lt 3</m> we already established, we have
<me> |2x+1|\leq |2x|+1=2|x|+1 \lt 2\cdot3+1=7. </me>
Thus
<me> |2x^2-3x-2| \lt |2x+1|\cdot1 \lt 7\cdot 1=7. </me>
</p></proof>
