<statement>
<p>
Prove the following statement:
</p>
<p>
If <m>x+y</m> is odd, then either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd, but not both.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Think carefully about the contrapositive.
</p>
</hint>
<answer>
<p>
We would like to prove the contrapositive, but first we need to figure out what the contrapositive statement is. Following the technical definition, we know that the contrapositive is
<em>If <m>\neg</m>(<m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd, but not both), then <m>\neg</m>(<m>x+y</m> is odd)</em>. But we would like to translate this into a statement that is easier to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
There are four possibilities for the parities of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>x</m> is even and <m>y</m> is odd.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>x</m> is odd and <m>y</m>  is even.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
Options 2 and 3 fit the condition <em><m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd, but not both</em>. Therefore, <em><m>\neg</m>(<m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd, but not both)</em> is satisfied by conditions 1 and 4. We can summarize these two conditions as <q><m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have the same parity.</q> Moreover, we can rewrite the statement <em><m>\neg</m>(<m>x+y</m> is odd)</em> as <q><m>x+y</m> is even.</q>
</p>
<p>
Putting these together, we get the contrapositive:
 <em>If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have the same parity, then <m>x+y</m> is even</em>.
</p>
</answer>

<solution>
<proof><p>
We proceed by contrapositive. We see that thee contrapositive of the statement is: If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have the same parity, then <m>x+y</m> is even.  Now assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even or both odd. Then we have 2 cases:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Case 1: Assume that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are even. Then <m>x=2n</m> and <m>y=2m</m> for some <m>n,m\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Therefore,
<me>x+y = 2n+2m =2(n+m).</me>
Since <m>n, m \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and the sum of integers is also an integer, we see that <m>n+m\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, so that <m>x+y</m> fits the definition of an even number, as required.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Case 2: Assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd. Then <m>x=2j+1</m> and <m>y=2k+1</m> for some <m>j,k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then
<me>x+y = 2j+1+2k+1 = 2(j+k+1).</me>
Since <m>j,k,1 \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and the sum of integers is an integer, <m>j+k+1\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, and we see that <m>x+y</m> is even, as desired.
</p></li>
</ul>
