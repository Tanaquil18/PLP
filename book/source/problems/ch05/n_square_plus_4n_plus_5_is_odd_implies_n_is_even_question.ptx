<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n\in\mathbb Z</m>. Prove that if <m>n^2+4n+5</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is even.
</p>
</statement>
<answer>
<p>
We see that this is a conditional statement and as we did in the previous chapters, we can try direct proof where we assume the hypothesis and show the conclusion. That means, we assume that <m>n^2+4n+5</m> is odd and show that <m>n</m> is even.
</p>
<p>
This means that we assume <m>n^2+4n+5=2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb Z</m> and show that <m>n=2m</m> for some <m>m\in\mathbb Z</m>. However, to get from  <m>n^2+4n+5=2k+1</m> to showing that <m>n</m> is even will not an easy task. It would require us to take a square root, and so we would also need to understand the effect of taking square root on the parity of the number. Oof! That would be a whole other exercise.

So, we may need to look at a different proof method. Since this is a conditional statement, we can look at its contrapositive and see whether it simplifies the problem. First, let <m>n\in\mathbb Z</m>, then the contrapositive is:
<md>
<mrow>
  n \text{ is not odd } \implies n^2+4n+5 \text{ is not odd}.
</mrow>
</md>
But since <m>n</m> is an integer, we know that <m>n^2+4n+5</m> is an integer. So if <m>n</m> and <m>n^2+4n+5</m> are not odd, then they must be even. Hence we can write the contrapositive as
<md>
<mrow>
  n \text{ is odd } \implies n^2+4n+5 \text{ is even}.
</mrow>
</md>
This immediately looks like a simpler statement since the hypothesis in on <m>n</m>, which is the simpler term, and the conclusion is on <m>n^2+4n+5</m>, which is the more complex term. From here, the rest of the proof is straightforward. We assume <m>n=2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb Z</m> and then we write the expression for <m>n^2+4n+5</m> and show that it is even. Namely,

<solution>
<proof><p>
(Proof by contrapositive) Assume that <m>n</m> is odd. Then we see that <m>n=2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, <m>n^2+4n+5=(2k+1)^2+4(2k+1)+5=2(2k^2+6k+3)</m>. Since <m>(2k^2+6k+3)\in\mathbb Z</m>, we see that <m>n^2+4n+5</m> is even.
</p></proof>

Notice that we have started our proof with an indication to the reader that we are using the contrapositive. Always make things easier for your reader.
