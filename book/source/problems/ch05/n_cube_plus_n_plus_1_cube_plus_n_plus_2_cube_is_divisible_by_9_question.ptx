<statement>
<p>
Prove that if <m>n\in\mathbb Z</m>, then the sum <m>n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3</m> is divisible by <m>9</m>.

<solution>
<p>
We see that this is a conditional statement, so we can assume the hypothesis and try to show the conclusion. This means that we assume that <m>n\in\mathbb Z</m> and show that <m>n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3</m> is divisible by <m>9</m>. Since the hypothesis is very broad, this suggests that we use proof by cases; and since the result is about divisibility by <m>9</m>, this suggests that we use <m>9</m> cases using division algorithm. But, this looks too much.
</p>
<p>
What we can do is to rewrite what we want to show and see whether it simplifies. We see

<mrow>
n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3 \amp =n^3+(n^3+3n^2+3n+1)+(n^3+6n^2+12n+8)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3n^3+9n^2+15n+9
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3(n^3+5n)+9(n^2+1)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3n(n^2+5)+9(n^2+1).
</mrow>
</md>
This means that all we need to do is to show <m>3n(n^2+5)+9(n^2+1)=9k</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb Z</m>. Rewriting this, we see that we want to show <m>3n(n^2+5)=9t</m> for some <m>t\in\mathbb Z</m>, i.e. <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m>. Even though this would still require cases, now we would be done with only <m>3</m> cases since we are now dealing with divisibility by <m>3</m>. Let's see how we can make use of this in the proof.
</p>

<proof><p>
Let <m>n\in\mathbb Z</m>. Then, we have
<md>
<mrow>
n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3 \amp =n^3+(n^3+3n^2+3n+1)+(n^3+6n^2+12n+8)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3n^3+9n^2+15n+9
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3(n^3+5n)+9(n^2+1)
</mrow><mrow>
 \amp =3n(n^2+5)+9(n^2+1).
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
<p>
We see that <m>9\mid 9(n^2+1)</m>. Hence, to show <m>9\mid \big(n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3\big)</m>, it is enough to show <m>9\mid 3n(n^2+5)</m>, or equivalently <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m>. To prove that we use cases.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Case 1: <m>n\equiv 0 \mod 3</m> : In this case, we see that <m>n(n^2+5)\equiv 0\mod 3</m>, which implies that <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Case 2: <m>n\equiv 1 \mod 3</m> : In this case, we see that <m>n^2\equiv 1\mod 3</m>, which implies that <m>(n^2+5)\equiv 0\mod 3</m>. Thus, <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Case 3: <m>n\equiv 2 \mod 3</m> : In this case, we see that <m>n^2\equiv 4\equiv 1\mod 3</m>, which implies that <m>(n^2+5)\equiv 0\mod 3</m>. Thus, <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we see that <m>3\mid n(n^2+5)</m> for all <m>n</m>, and thus, for every integer <m>n\geq 0</m>, the sum <m>n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3</m> is divisible by <m>9</m>.
</p></proof>

<p>
In our proof here we have proved a small additional result to help us prove the main result. We could have, instead, made that small result a separate lemma and proved it separately. Both approaches are common practice.
