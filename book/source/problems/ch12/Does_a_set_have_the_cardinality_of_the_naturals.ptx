<statement>
<p>
Suppose <m>A = \{(m, j) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}: j = \pi m\}</m>. Is it true that <m>|\mathbb N| = |A|</m>?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<em>Claim:</em> It is true that <m>|A|=|\mathbb{N}|</m>.
</p>

<proof><p>
We define a function <m>f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A</m> by <m>f(k)=(k,k\pi)</m>.
</p>
<p>
Suppose <m>f(n) = f(\ell)</m> for some <m>n, \ell \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Then <m>(n, n\pi) = (\ell, \ell\pi)</m>, and in particular, the first entries in the pair must match, so <m>n=\ell</m>. Thus, <m>f</m> is injective.
</p>
<p>
Now, consider <m>a\in A</m>. By the definition of <m>A</m>, this element takes the form <m>a = (m, \pi m)</m> for some <m>m\in \mathbb{N}</m>. Therefore <m>f(m) = a</m>, and we see that <m>f</m> is surjective.
</p>
<p>
We conclude that <m>|A|=|\mathbb{N}|</m>.
