<statement>
<p>
Show that the following pairs of sets are equinumerous.
<ol marker="(a)">

 <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m>
</p></li>

For part (a), try to define an injection from each set to the other; you can then use <xref ref="thm_CSB">Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein</xref> to infer there is a bijection between the sets.
For the function from <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m> to <m>(0,1)</m>, consider the decimal representation of elements in <m>(0,1)</m>.

<ol marker="(a)">
  <li>
    <p>
      <xref ref="thm_CSB">Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein</xref> tells us that
    it is enough to find an injection from <m>(0,1) \to (0,1)^2</m>
    and then another injection back. The first injection is easy, we
    can take, say, the function <m>f:(0,1) \to (0,1)^2</m> defined by
    <m>f(x) = (x,1/2)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The injection back is harder; we need to make a pair of reals
      <m>(a,b)</m> to a single real <m>c</m>. A nice <q>trick</q> uses
      the decimal expansions of <m>a,b</m>. In particular, we can
      write <m>a = 0.a_1a_2a_3\dots, b=0.b_1b_2b_3\dots</m>. We can
      then interleave these expansions to create a new number <m>c =
      0.a_1b_1a_2b_2a_3b_3\dots</m>. Some care is required to ensure
      that this mapping is injective.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    We already know that <m>|(0,1)| = |\mathbb{R}|</m> and so we know
    that there is a bijection between these sets. We can then leverage
    that bijection to construct a bijection between
    <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m> and <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>. Then part (a)
    tells us that <m>|(0,1)\times(0,1)| = |(0,1)|</m>. And then again
    we can use <m>|(0,1)|=|R|</m>. Putting all these together gives us
    the required result.

<proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
<p>
 We will prove this statement using <xref
 ref="thm_CSB">Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein</xref>, defining an injection
 from <m>(0,1)</m> to <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m>, and another injection
 in the reverse direction.  This is easier than trying to define an
 explicit bijection from one set to the other; as we will see, the
 fact that some numbers have two distinct decimal representations
 causes trouble if we tried that approach instead.
</p>

<p>
First let's define an injection <m>f:(0,1)\rightarrow (0,1)\times(0,1)</m>. We can take
<me> f(x)=(x,1/2), </me>
so that <m>f</m> maps the interval <m>(0,1)</m> onto a strip contained in the square <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m>.
</p>
<p>
Next, we try to define an injection  <m>g:(0,1)\times(0,1)\rightarrow (0,1)</m>. This direction is trickier.
In <xref ref="sec_uncount"/>, we saw that any element <m>a\in (0,1)</m> can be written as a decimal expansion,
<me> a = 0.a_1a_2a_3\dots \quad a_i\in\{0,1,\dots,9\}. </me>
Moreover, we discussed that this representation is unique, with the exception of numbers whose digits are eventually all zero or nine, such as
<me> 1/2 = 0.5000\dots = 0.4999\dots </me>
In these cases, we choose the representation ending in all zeros. Therefore, none of the decimal expansions will end in all repeating nines.
</p>
<p>
Let <m>(a,b)\in (0,1)\times(0,1)</m>, which we write as
<me> (a,b)=(0.a_1a_2a_3\dots, 0.b_1b_2b_3\dots). </me>
We want to map this to a single element in <m>(0,1)</m>. We'll identify this element by its own decimal representation, which will be defined in terms of the digits <m>a_i</m> and <m>b_i</m>.
Since there are infinitely digits in the expansions of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we'll need to combine their digits by going back and forth between the <m>a_i</m> and <m>b_i</m>.
Define
<me> g((a,b))=0.a_1b_1a_2b_2a_3b_3\dots </me>
We need to check that this map is injective.
</p>
<p>
Injectivity will follow in most cases by the uniqueness of the decimal representation. However, we need to be careful for numbers that have two representations, like <m>1/2</m>.
In such a case, one of these representations ends in repeating nines. In order for <m>0.a_1b_1a_2b_2a_3b_3\dots</m> to end in repeating nines, the digit expansions chosen for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> would also need to end in repeating nines.
But this can't happen, since we already made the choice to not use any decimal expansions ending in all nines, opting for the expansion ending in zeros instead.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the function <m>g</m> isn't a surjective. For example, the element
<me> (0.5, 0.1119191919\dots) </me>
is not in the range of <m>g</m>; indeed, if it were, then we would need <m>b=0.1999\dots</m>, but for this number we use the representation <m>0.200\dots</m> instead.
</p>
</proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (b)</title>
<p>
 From <xref ref="ex_R_unit_equinumerous"/>, we know that <m>|(0,1)|=|\mathbb{R}|</m>. So there is a bijection <m>h:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}</m>.
We can use <m>h</m> to form a bijection <m>H</m> from <m>(0,1)\times(0,1)</m> to <m>\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}</m>. Indeed, let
<me> H((x,y))=(h(x),h(y)). </me>
Since <m>h</m> is invertible, <m>H</m> is as well; namely,
<me> H^{-1}((x,y))=(h^{-1}(x),h^{-1}(y)). </me>
Thus <m>H</m> is indeed bijective. Therefore
<me> |(0,1)\times(0,1)|=|\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}|. </me>
From part (a), we know that
<me> |(0,1)|=|(0,1)\times(0,1)| </me>
and we also already know that <m>|(0,1)|=|\mathbb{R}|</m>. Putting all these cardinality equalities together, we have <m>|\mathbb{R}^2|=|\mathbb{R}|</m>, as desired.
