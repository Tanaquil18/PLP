<statement>
<p>
Let <m>S</m> be the set of all functions <m>f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \set{0, 1}</m>. Prove that <m>S</m> is uncountable.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the codomain of these functions is the set that contains just two elements, zero and one. It is not the set of all reals between 0 and 1.

<answer>
<p>
Question 13 in Section 10 suggests that we should be able to construct a bijective function <m>g: S\to\pow{N}</m> (as done in that question) implying that <m>S</m> is uncountable.
</p>
</answer>
<solution>

<proof>
<p>
Consider the function <m>G: S \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})</m> defined by <m>G(f) = \{n: f(n)=1 \}</m>. We claim that <m>G</m> is a bijection. This implies that <m>|S| = |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|</m> and thus is uncountable.
</p>
<p>
To prove the claim, it suffices to show that <m>G</m> is injective and surjective.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 (Injectivity) Suppose that <m>f, h \in S</m> such that <m>G(f) = G(h)</m>. Then we have
<me>
\set{n: f(n)=1 } = \set{n: h(n)=1 },
</me>
So the functions <m>f,h</m> take the value <m>1</m> at the same inputs. At any other value of <m>n</m> the functions must be zero. Hence they take the value <m>1</m> at the same times and the value <m>0</m> at the same time. So <m>f = h</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 (Surjectivity) Suppose that <m>X \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})</m> and so <m>X \subseteq \mathbb{N}</m>. Define <m>f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \set{0, 1}</m> by
    <me>
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
    1 \quad \text{if } n \in X
    \\
    0 \quad \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
    </me>
    Then we have <m>G(f) = X</m> by definition.
</p></li>
</ul>
