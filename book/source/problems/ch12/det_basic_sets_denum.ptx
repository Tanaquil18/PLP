<li>
<p>
 Since we're trying to figure out whether or not <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is denumerable, let's assume that it is, and see what kind of conclusion we may reach. That is, let's see if under this assumption we reach a contradiction.
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
 We know that <me> [0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{Q}, </me> and
 that <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable. Since any subset of a
 denumerable set is countable, and the subset is infinite, it must be
 denumerable.
</p>
  
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The set
<me> \set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}} </me>
shifts the set of rational numbers by <m>\pi</m>. Intuitively, we think that shifting shouldn't change the size of a set, but of course, we need to prove this by showing that the set is denumerable, like <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
Indeed, we can define a bijection between <m>\set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> and <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>. Since <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable, the other is too.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
 Part (c) is a special case of this, with <m>a=\pi</m>. We need to check that the argument given in part (c) works when <m>a</m> is an arbitrary real number.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
 The set
<me> \set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}} </me>
scales the set of rational numbers by <m>\pi</m>. In comparison to part (c), it may not be as intuitive that this set has the same size as the rational numbers. However,
we can define the bijection <m>g(q)=\pi q</m> from the rational numbers to <m>\set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m>.
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
 Part (e) is a special case of this, with <m>a=\pi</m>. We need to check that the argument given in part (e) works when <m>a</m> is an arbitrary real number.

  <proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
    <p>
Assume, towards contradiction, that <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is denumerable. Then both <m>\mathbb{I}</m>  and <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> are countable, and by <xref ref="res_count_union_intersect"/>,
<me> \mathbb{R}=\mathbb{I}\cup\mathbb{Q} </me>
is countable as well. But this is a contradiction, since the real numbers are uncountable. Hence <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is uncountable.
</p></proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (b)</title>
<p>
 We know that
<me> [0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{Q}, </me>
and that <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable. Hence, by <xref ref="thm_countable_subset"/>, <m>[0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}</m> is countable.
Moreover, <m>[0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}</m> is infinite, since it contains the set <m>\set{1/n:n\in\mathbb{N}}</m>. Since the set is countable and infinite, it must be denumerable.
</p>
</proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (c)</title>
<p>
Let <m>f:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> be given by <m>f(q)=\pi+q</m>. This function is surjective: if <m>x\in \set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m>, then
<m>x=\pi+q</m> for some <m>q\in \mathbb{Q}</m>. But then <m>f(q)=x</m>. The function is injective: if <m>f(q)=f(r)</m>, then <m>\pi+q=\pi+r</m>, and so <m>q=r</m>.
Therefore <m>f</m> is a bijection, and
<me> |\set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}|=|\mathbb{Q}| </me>
and as <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable, <m>\set{\pi+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> is as well.
</p></proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (d)</title>
<p>
Let <m>f:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\set{a+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> be given by <m>f(q)=a+q</m>. This function is surjective: if <m>x\in \set{a+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m>, then
<m>x=a+q</m> for some <m>q\in \mathbb{Q}</m>. But then <m>f(q)=x</m>. The function is injective: if <m>f(q)=f(r)</m>, then <m>a+q=a+r</m>, and so <m>q=r</m>.
Therefore <m>f</m> is a bijection, and
<me> |\set{a+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}|=|\mathbb{Q}| </me>
and as <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable, <m>\set{a+q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> is as well.
</p></proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (e)</title>
  <p>
Let <m>g:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> be given by <m>g(q)=\pi q</m>. This function is surjective: if <m>x\in \set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m>, then
<m>x=\pi q</m> for some <m>q\in \mathbb{Q}</m>. But then <m>g(q)=x</m>. The function is injective: if <m>g(q)=g(r)</m>, then <m>\pi q=\pi r</m>, and so <m>q=r</m>.
Therefore <m>g</m> is a bijection, and
<me> |\set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}|=|\mathbb{Q}| </me>
and as <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is denumerable, <m>\set{\pi q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> is as well.
</p></proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (f)</title>
<p>
  As in the proof of (e), we can define the function <m>g:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\set{a q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> by <m>g(q)=a q</m>.
</p>
<p>
The argument for surjectivity is similar as part (e):
if <m>x\in \set{a q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m>, then <m>x=a q</m> for some <m>q\in \mathbb{Q}</m>, and <m>g(q)=x</m>.
However, we have to be careful with injectivity. Suppose <m>g(q)=g(r)</m>, in which case <m>a q=ar</m>. This implies that <m>q=r</m> as long as <m>a\neq0</m>.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we see that when <m>a\neq0</m>, <m>g</m> is a bijection and <m>\set{a q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}</m> is denumerable.
If <m>a=0</m>, then <m>\set{a q:q\in\mathbb{Q}}=\set{0}</m>, and so the set is finite, not denumerable.
