<statement>
<p>
Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. Let <m>P</m> be a partition of <m>A</m>, and let <m>Q</m> be a partition of <m>B</m>. Suppose that we have a bijection between the partitions, <m>h\colon P\to Q</m>, with the additional property that <m>|X| = |h(X)|</m> for every set <m>X\in P</m>.
</p>
<p>
Prove that the underlying sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, have the same cardinality.

<ul>
<li>
<p>
 The function <m>h</m> is not a from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, it is a function from the partition <m>P</m> to the partition <m>Q</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 What does it mean for <m>X</m> and <m>h(X)</m> have the same cardinality?

<answer>
<p>
We saw in <xref ref="ex_union_of_equinumerous"/> that if <m>A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2</m> are any nonempty sets satisfying <m>A_1\cap A_2=\emptyset</m> and <m>B_1\cap B_2=\emptyset</m>, and that <m>|A_1|=|B_1|</m> and <m>|A_2|=|B_2|</m>, then we have <m>|A_1\cup A_2|=|B_1\cup B_2|</m>. The idea in the proof relied on the fact that since <m>|A_1|=|B_1|</m> and <m>|A_2|=|B_2|</m>, there are bijections <m>f:A_1\to B_1</m> and <m>g: A_2\to B_2</m>. Using these functions, we could construct a piecewise function <m>h:A_1\cup A_2 \to B_1\cup B_2</m> that turned out to be a bijection as well.
</p>
<p>
We can see this result as a specific example to this question, where our partitions for the sets <m>A=A_1\cup A_2</m> and <m>B=B_1\cup B_2</m> are given as
</p>
<p>
<me>P=\set{A_1, A_2},
</me>
and
<me>Q=\set{B_1, B_2}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
Then, we see that <m>F:P\to Q</m>, defined as <m>F(A_1)=B_1</m>, and <m>F(A_2)=B_2</m> is a bijection from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>, and moreover <m>|A_1|=|B_1|</m> and <m>|A_2|=|B_2|</m>.
</p>
<p>
This suggests that if we have partitions with more sets in them, we should be able to construct a bijection in a very similar piecewise manner. Also, since sets in a partition are mutually disjoint, and that their union gives the entire set, such a construction would still work.

<solution>

<proof>
<p>
For each <m>X\in P</m>, since <m>X</m> and <m>h(X)</m> have the same cardinality, there exists a bijection <m>g_X\colon X\to h(X)</m>. Define <m>f</m> to be the union of all these <m>g_X</m>:
<me>
f = \{ (a,b)\colon \text{there exists } X\in P \text{ such that } a\in X \text{ and } b = g_X(a) \}.
</me>
Of course, it is not immediately obvious that this is a function, let alone that it is a bijection. We must prove that.
</p>
<p>
We show that <m>f</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, that it is surjective, and that it is injective.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 For any <m>(a,b)\in f</m>, choose <m>X\in P</m> such that <m>a\in X</m> and <m>b=g_X(a)</m>. Since <m>X\in P</m> and <m>P</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>, we know that <m>X\subset A</m>, and therefore <m>a\in A</m>. Similarly, <m>g_X(a)\in h(X)</m> and <m>h(X)\in Q</m>; since <m>Q</m> is a partition of <m>B</m>, we see that <m>h(X) \subset B</m>, and so <m>b=g_X(a)\in B</m>. This shows that <m>f\subset A\times B</m>.
</p>
<p>
Let <m>a\in A</m> be arbitrary. Since <m>P</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>, there is a unique <m>X\in P</m> with <m>a\in X</m>. Since <m>g_X</m> is a function from <m>X</m> to <m>h(X)</m>, there is a unique <m>b</m> such that <m>g_X(a)=b</m>. This shows that there is a unique <m>b\in B</m> with <m>f(a)=b</m>, and so <m>f</m> is a function.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Let <m>b\in B</m> be arbitrary. Since <m>Q</m> is a partition of <m>B</m>, there exists <m>Y\in Q</m> with <m>b\in Y</m>. Since <m>h</m> is surjective, there exists <m>X\in P</m> with <m>h(X)=Y</m>, and therefore <m>g_X</m> is a function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>. Since <m>g_X</m> is surjective, there exists <m>a\in X</m> such that <m>g_X(a)=b</m>. By definition, we see that <m>f(a) = b</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Let <m>a_1,a_2\in A</m>, and suppose that <m>f(a_1)=f(a_2)</m>. Since <m>Q</m> is a partition of <m>B</m>, there is a unique <m>Y\in Q</m> with <m>f(a_1)=f(a_2)\in Y</m>. Since <m>h\colon P\to Q</m> is injective, there is a unique <m>X\in P</m> with <m>h(X) = Y</m>. This <m>X</m> corresponds to the only function <m>g_X</m> whose codomain is <m>Y</m>, and so we must have <m>a_1,a_2\in X</m> and <m>f(a_1) = g_X(a_1)</m> and <m>f(a_2)=g_X(a_2)</m>. Since <m>g_X</m> is injective, we conclude that <m>a_1=a_2</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is injective.
