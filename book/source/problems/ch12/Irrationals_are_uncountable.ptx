<statement>
<p>
Prove that the set of all irrational numbers is uncountable. You may assume the fact that the set of real numbers is uncountable.

</statement>
<solution>

<proof><p>
Let <m>\mathbb{I}</m> denote the set of irrational numbers. By way of contradiction, assume that <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is countable. Then we see that <m>\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{Q}\cup\mathbb{I}</m>. Since <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is countable and <m>\mathbb{I}</m> is countable, and the union of countable sets is countable, we conclude that <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is countable, which is a contradiction. Therefore the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
