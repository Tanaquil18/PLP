<proof><title>Proof using decimals</title>
  <p>
    Let <m>\mathcal{A} = \set{(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots): a_i
    \in\mathbb{Z}}</m>, and consider
    <me>
      \mathcal{B}=\set{(b_1, b_2, b_3, \dots): b_i\in \{0, 1, \dots,
      9\} \text{ and} \not\exists k\in \mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } b_n =
      9 \,\forall \,n \gt k }\subset \mathcal{A}.
    </me>
    That is, infinite sequences of natural numbers from <m>0</m> to
    <m>9</m> which do not end in infinitely many consecutive
    <m>9</m>'s. We will first show that <m>\mathcal{B}</m> is
    uncountable by constructing a bijection from <m>\mathcal{B}</m> to
    <m>[0,1)</m>. Define <m>f: \mathcal{B}\to [0,1)</m> by <me>f((b_1,
    b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, \dots)) = 0.b_1b_2b_3b_4b_5\dots.</me> This
    functions takes the <m>i^{th}</m> coordinate of <m>(b_1, b_2, b_3,
    b_4, b_5, \dots)</m> and sends it to the <m>i^{th}</m> decimal
    place following <m>0</m>. For example
    <me>
      f((1,2,3,4,5,6, \dots))= 0.123456\dots.
    </me>
</p>
<p>
  To see that <m>f</m> is injective, let <m>x= (x_1, x_2, x_3,
  \dots)</m> and <m>y=(y_1, y_2, y_3, \dots)</m> be elements of
  <m>\mathcal{B}</m> and suppose that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Then
  <me>
    0.x_1x_2x_3\dots = 0.y_1y_2y_3\dots.
  </me>
  Since our sequence does not terminate in 9's, each real number in <m>[0,1)</m> has a unique decimal representation, and we must have
<md>
<mrow>
    x_1  \amp = y_1  \amp 
    x_2  \amp =y_2  \amp 
    x_3  \amp = y_3  \amp  \cdots
</mrow>
</md>
Therefore <m>x=y</m> and <m>f</m> is injective. It remains to show that <m>f</m> is surjective. Suppose <m>s\in [0,1)</m>. Then <m>s</m> takes the form
<me>
  0.s_1s_2s_3s_4s_5\dots
</me>
where <m>s_j\in \{0, 1, \dots, 9\}</m>. Since
<me>
  f((s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, \dots)) = 0.s_1s_2s_3s_4s_5\dots
</me>
we have found an element of <m>\mathcal{B}</m> mapping to <m>s</m>, so
<m>f</m> is surjective. Therefore, <m>|\mathcal{B}| = |[0,1)|</m>, so
<m>\mathcal{B}</m> is uncountable. Since <m>\mathcal{B} \subset
\mathcal{A}</m>, <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is uncountable as well.
</p>
</proof>

<proof><title>Alternative proof</title>
<p>
We are going to prove this set is uncountable by showing that it has
an uncountable subset. Let <m>\mathcal{A} = \set{(a_1, a_2, a_3,
\ldots): a_i \in\mathbb{Z}}</m>, and let <m>\mathcal{C}=\{(c_1, c_2,
c_3, \ldots): c_i \in\set{0,1}\}</m>. Then, we see that
<m>\mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}</m>. Now, we can show that
<m>\mathcal{C}</m> is uncountable by finding a bijection from
<m>\mathcal{C}</m> to <m>\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})</m>.
</p>
<p>
We can define the bijection <m>f</m> as follows:
</p>
<p>
<md>
<mrow>
f:\mathcal{C} \amp \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})
</mrow><mrow>
f(c_1, c_2, c_3, \ldots) \amp =\{ k\in\mathbb{N}: c_k=1 \}.
</mrow>
</md>
for example,  <m>f(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,\ldots)=\{2,4\}</m>.
</p>
<p>
We see that <m>f</m> is surjective since for any <m> X\subseteq\mathbb{N}</m>, we can construct the sequence <m>(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)</m>, where <m>x_k=1</m> if <m>k\in X</m> and <m>0</m> otherwise. Then, <m>f(x_1, x_2, x_3,\ldots)=X</m>.
</p>
<p>
  We also see that <m>f</m> is injective since if <m>(a_1, a_2, a_3,
  \ldots)\neq (b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots)</m>, then <m>\exists
  m\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>a_m=1</m> and <m>b_m=0</m>, in which
  case <m>m\in f(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)</m> and <m>m\notin f(b_1, b_2,
  b_3, \ldots)</m>, or <m>a_m=0</m> and <m>b_m=1</m>, in which case
  <m>m\notin f(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)</m> and <m>m\in f(b_1, b_2, b_3,
  \ldots)</m>. In both cases, we see <m> f(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)\neq
  f(b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots)</m>. We conclude that <m>f</m> is a
  bijection. Therefore we see that <m>|\mathcal{C}|=|
  \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|</m>, which means <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is
  uncountable. Thus, <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is uncountable too.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
  Note: We can also use a diagonal argument directly to show that the set <m>\{(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots): a_i \in\mathbb Z\}</m> is uncountable.
