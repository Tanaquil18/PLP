<statement>
<p>
Let <m>\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> be a sequence. We say that a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is <em>bounded</em> if there is some <m>M\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that
<m>|a_n|\leq M</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 Show that if <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L</m> for some <m>L\in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is bounded.

</li>

 Show that the converse of the statement in (a) is false.

<hint>
<p>
Split the sequence at some large <m>N</m>, so that when <m>n\geq N</m>, we know that <m>a_n</m> is really close to <m>L</m>. We can use this to bound <m>|a_n|</m> when <m>n\geq N</m>.
That leaves us to bound only finitely many of the terms <m>|a_n|</m>, the terms for which <m>n\lt N</m>. While we cannot take the maximum of an infinite set of values, we can find the maximum of a finite set of values and it will be finite.
See <xref ref="ex_faulty_proof_max"/> which explores this point.

 By definition of the limit, we know that for any <m>\epsilon\gt0</m> there is some <m>N_\epsilon\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that
<me> n\geq N_\epsilon\implies |a_n-L|\lt\epsilon. </me>
We would like to use the inequality <m>|a_n-L|\lt\epsilon</m> to bound <m>|a_n|</m> from above.
We can do this by writing <m>|a_n|=|L+(a_n-L)|</m> and applying the triangle inequality.
Indeed, we have
<me> |a_n|=|L+(a_n-L)|\leq |L|+|a_n-L|\lt |L|+\epsilon. </me>
This inequality is true for all <m>n\geq N_\epsilon</m>, where <m>N_\epsilon</m> depends on our choice of <m>\epsilon\gt0</m>.
We are free to choose <m>\epsilon</m>, so let's take <m>\epsilon=1</m>. So for <m>n\geq N_1</m>, we have
<me> |a_n-L|\lt 1\implies |a_n|\lt |L|+1. </me>
</p>
<p>
Now, we only have to bound
<me> |a_1|, |a_2|, \dots, |a_{N_1-1}|. </me>
But there are only finitely many values here, so
<me> M_0=\max\{|a_1|, |a_2|, \dots, |a_{N_1-1}|\} </me>
exists, and is a real number. So for any value of <m>n</m>, we know that <m>|a_n|\leq M_0</m> if <m>1\leq n\lt N_1</m>, or <m>|a_n|\leq |L|+1</m> if <m>n\geq N_1</m>.
Therefore we may take <m>M=\max\{M_0, |L|+1\}</m>.

<li>
<p>
 We need to find a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> that is bounded, but does not converge. We can try a sequence that oscillates between two fixed numbers, say the sequence <m>a_n=(-1)^n</m>. This sequence is bounded, as <m>|a_n|\leq 1</m> for all <m>n</m>.
Intuitively, this sequence shouldn't converge since it doesn't get arbitrarily close to a single number.
Indeed, in <xref ref="eg_minus_1_to_n_conv"/>, we saw that this sequence doesn't converge to <m>1</m>. But we need to show a bit more than that for the purposes of this question; we need to show that for any <m>L\in\mathbb{R}</m>, the sequence doesn't converge to <m>L</m>.
</p>
<p>
To this end, we'll fix <m>L\in \mathbb{R}</m>. To show that <m>a_n</m> doesn't converge to <m>L</m>, we need to find some <m>\epsilon</m> so that the following is true:
<me> \forall N\in\mathbb{N}\; \exists n\geq N\; \text{ such that } \; |a_n-L|\geq\epsilon. </me>
In <xref ref="eg_minus_1_to_n_conv"/>, we saw that for <m>L=1</m> we could take <m>\epsilon=1</m>, because then for any odd <m>n</m>, <m>|a_n-1|=|-1-1|\gt 1</m>.

<proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
<p>
Let <m>\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> be a sequence that converges to <m>L\in\mathbb{R}</m>. Then by definition, there is some <m>N_1\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that
for all <m>n\geq N_1</m>, we have <m>|a_n-L| \lt 1</m>. Therefore for <m>n\geq N_1</m>,
<me> |a_n|=|L+(a_n-L)|\leq |L|+|a_n-L|\lt |L|+\epsilon. </me>
Let
<me> M=\max\{|a_1|,|a_2|, \dots, |a_{N_1-1}|,|L|+\epsilon\}, </me>
which exists, since we are taking the maximum of only finitely many real numbers. But then
for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, <m>|a_n|\leq M</m>, so <m>\{a_n\}</m> is bounded.
</p></proof>

<proof><title>Proof of (b)</title>
  <p>
Let <m>L\in\mathbb{R}</m>, and take <m>\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}\max\{|1-L|,|-1-L|\}</m>. Note that <m>\epsilon\gt0</m>.
Let <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m>. If <m>\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}|1-L|</m>, take <m>n=2N</m>. Then we have <m>n\geq N</m> but
<me> |a_n-L|=|(-1)^{2N}-L|=|1-L|=2\epsilon\gt \epsilon. </me>
If <m>\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}|-1-L|</m>, take <m>n=2N+1</m>. Then we have <m>n\geq N</m> but
<me> |a_n-L|=|(-1)^{2N+1}-L|=|-1-L|=2\epsilon\gt \epsilon. </me>
In both cases, we have some <m>n\geq N</m> such that <m>|a_n-L|\gt \epsilon</m>, and so <m>a_n</m> does not converge to <m>L</m>.
As <m>L</m> was an arbitrary real number, <m>a_n</m> does not converge.
