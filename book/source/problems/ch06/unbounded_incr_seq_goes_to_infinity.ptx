Before completing this question, you should look over <xref ref="ex_bounded_seq"/>.
</p>
<p>
A sequence <m> (a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is <em>bounded</em> if there is some <m>M\geq 0</m> such that <m>|a_n|\leq M</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>. If no such <m>M</m> exists, then we say <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is <em>unbounded</em>.
</p>
<p>
We say that <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is <em>increasing</em> if <m>a_{n+1}\geq a_n</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.

Parts (a) and (b) tell us that when proving the statement in part (c), we need to use both conditions given.

<p>
For part (c), the contrapositive can help. Also, see <xref ref="ex_log_equiv_tt"/><nbsp/>(c).

<answer>
<p>
  We will prove part (c) by contrapositive. The contrapositive of the statement given in the question is
  <me>
    \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty\implies  (a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \text{ is bounded, or } (a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \text{ is not increasing.}
  </me>
  So this statement is of the form <m>P \implies (R \lor \neg Q) </m>. Now <m>Q</m> is either true or false
  <ul>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>Q</m> is false, then <m>R \lor \neg Q</m> is false, and so <m>P \implies F</m> is true. Easy!
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 While if <m>Q</m> is true, then <m>R \lor \neg Q</m> is true only when <m>R</m> is true, and so we have to show that <m>P \implies R</m> is true.
  </p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Also notice that this statement is of the same form as <xref ref="ex_log_equiv_tt"/><nbsp/>(c), and so is logically equivalent to
  <me>
  \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty\implies \left( (a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \text{ is increasing} \implies a_n \text{ is bounded.} \right)
  </me>
  and so is of the form <m>P \implies (Q \implies R)</m>. Now, either <m>Q</m> is true or false:
  <ul>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>Q</m> is false, then <m>F \implies R</m> is true, and so <m>P \implies T</m> is true. Easy!
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 On the other hand, if <m>Q</m> is true, then <m>T \implies R</m> is only true when <m>R</m> is true, so we really have to show that <m>P \implies R</m> is true.
  </p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  We know one of the following is true: either
  <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is not increasing, or it is increasing.
  We will use these two cases to prove the contrapositive statement.
  In the first case, when <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is not
  increasing, the conclusion (that <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is
  bounded or not increasing) is automatically satisfied.  Therefore we
  may focus on the second case, when <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is
  increasing.  We need to show that the sequence is bounded (then the
  conclusion, <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is bounded or not
  increasing, will be true).
</p>
<p>
By assumption, we know that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty</m>. By definition, this means there is some <m>C\gt0</m> such that for any <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, there's some <m>m\geq n</m> with <m>a_m\lt C</m>.
But since <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is increasing, we know that <m>a_n\leq a_m\lt C</m>. While it's not necessarily true that <m>a_n\leq a_m</m> for all <m>n</m>, since <m>m</m> depends on <m>n</m>, we do know that <m>a_n\lt C</m> for all <m>n</m>.
Moreover, we also know that <m>a_n\geq a_1</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, as <m>a_n</m> is increasing. Combining these inequalities to get <m>a_1\leq a_n\lt C</m>, we can show that <m>|a_n|</m> is bounded, as desired.

 We saw in part (d) of<nbsp/><xref ref="ex_infinite_limits"/>
  that <m>\lim_{n\to\infty}(-1)^n\sqrt{n}\neq+\infty</m>, and
  <m>((-1)^n\sqrt{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is an unbounded sequence.
  Indeed, given <m>M\geq 0</m>, we choose <m>N</m> be an integer
  strictly greater than <m>M^2</m>. Using the ceiling function, we set
 <m>N = \lceil M^2 \rceil +1</m>. Then <m>N\gt M^2</m> implies
  <m>|a_N|=\sqrt{N}\gt M</m>.

 We need to find a sequence that increases, and does not go to
  infinity. Take <m>a_n=-1/n</m>. Then <m>a_{n+1}\geq a_n</m> for all
  <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>. Moreover, given any <m>M\geq 0</m>, we have that
  <m>a_n\lt M</m> for all <m>n</m>. This implies that
  <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty</m>.

<proof><title>Proof of (c)</title>
<p>
Suppose that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty</m>, and that <m>a_n</m> is increasing.
We show that <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</m> is bounded. Since <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty</m>, there is some <m>C\gt0</m> such that for any <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, there's some <m>m\geq n</m> with <m>a_m\lt C</m>.
Fix <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m>, and let <m>m\geq n</m> be such that <m>a_m\lt C</m>. Since <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is increasing and <m>m\geq n</m>, we have
<me> a_n\leq a_m \lt C. </me>
But as <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is increasing, we also know that <m>a_1\leq a_n</m>. Let <m>M=\max\{|a_1|,|C|\}</m>. Note that
<me>-|a_1|\leq a_1\leq a_n \lt C \leq |C| </me>
But by choice of <m>M</m>, <m>|C|\leq M</m>, and <m>-M\leq -|a_1|</m>. Therefore
<me> -M \leq a_n \leq M, </me>
and so <m>|a_n|\leq M</m>. This holds for all <m>n</m>, and so <m>a_n</m> is bounded. Thus if <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq+\infty</m>, either <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is not increasing or <m>(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} </m> is bounded.
