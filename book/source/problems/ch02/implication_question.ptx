<statement>
<p>
In each of the following situations, determine whether or not it was raining on the given day, or explain why you cannot determine whether or not it was raining.
For each situation we give you two pieces of information that are true; one is an implication and one is a statement.
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 If it rains, then I bring an umbrella to work. I brought an umbrella to work on Monday.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If it rains, then I bring an umbrella to work. I did not bring an umbrella to work on Tuesday.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Whenever I am late for work, it rains. I was late to work on Wednesday.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Whenever I am late for work, it rains. I was not late to work on Thursday.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Carefully determine what is the hypothesis and what is the conclusion of each implication, and then refer to the truth table of the implication.

<solution>
<p>
Recall the truth table of the implication:
</p>

<tabular left="minor" right="minor" top="minor" bottom="minor" halign="center">
<row>
<cell><m>P</m></cell><cell><m>Q</m></cell><cell><m>P\implies Q</m></cell>
</row><row>
<cell> T  </cell><cell>  T  </cell><cell>  T  </cell>
</row><row>
<cell> T  </cell><cell>  F  </cell><cell>  F  </cell>
</row><row>
<cell>F  </cell><cell>  T  </cell><cell>  T  </cell>
</row><row>
<cell>F  </cell><cell>  F  </cell><cell>  T  </cell>
</row>
</tabular>

<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 We cannot determine whether or not it was raining on Monday.
The conclusion of the implication (<m>Q=</m> <q>I brought an umbrella to work</q>) is true, which means that the hypothesis (<m>P=</m> <q>it's raining</q>) may be true or false, while the implication remains true.
See the first and third rows of the truth table.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 It was not raining on Tuesday.
Because the conclusion of the implication if false, the hypothesis must also be false.
If the hypothesis were true, then the implication would be false.
See the second and fourth rows of the truth table.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 It was raining on Wednesday.
Because the hypothesis of the implication (<m>P=</m> <q>I am late for work</q>) is true, the conclusion (<m>Q=</m> <q>it's raining</q>) must also be true.
If the conclusion were false, then the implication would also be false.
See the first and second rows of the truth table.

 We cannot determine whether or not it was raining on Thursday.
