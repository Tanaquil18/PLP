<statement>
<p>
Write the following sentences in symbolic logic notation. Make sure to note which statements/open sentences are denoted with which letter.
</p>
<p>
<em>Example</em>: The sentence, <q>The car is red and blue but not green</q> can be written as <m>(P\land Q)\land (\neg R)</m>), where
<m>P</m>: <q>The car is red</q>, <m>Q</m>:  <q>The car is blue</q>, and <m>R</m>:  <q>The car is green</q>. Also, the truth value of this sentence depends on the car, so it is an open sentence, not a statement.
