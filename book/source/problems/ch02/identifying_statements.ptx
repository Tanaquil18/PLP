<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 If 13 is prime, then 6 is also prime.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If 6 is prime, then 13 is also prime.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>f(3)=2</m>
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 13 is prime and 6 is prime.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 13 is prime or 6 is prime.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 The circle's radius is equal to 1.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 This is a statement, and it is an implication.
Since the hypothesis of the implication is true, but the conclusion is false, the full statement is false.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 This is a statement.
Since the hypothesis of the implication is false, the full statement is automatically true.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 This is an open sentence, since it is true or false depending on the function <m>f</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 This is a statement, and a conjunction of the statement <q>13 is prime</q> and the statement <q>6 is prime.</q>
Since the first is true, but the second is false, the conjunction is false.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 This is a statement, and a disjunction of the statement <q>13 is prime</q> and the statement <q>6 is prime.</q>
Since the first is true, but the second is false, the disjunction is true.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 This is an open sentence, since it is true or false depending on the circle.
