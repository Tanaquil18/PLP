<statement>
<p>
Let <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m> be statements. Suppose that
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<q> <m>P\implies (Q\land R)</m> </q>is false, and
 </p></li>
<li>
<p>
<q> <m>\big((\neg Q)\land R\big) \implies (\neg P)</m></q> is true.
 </p></li>
</ul>
Which of <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m> can you determine are true or false?
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
What is the only situation in which an implication is false?
</p>
</hint>
<answer>
<p>
Recall that the only way an implication is false is if its conclusion is false while its hypothesis is true.
So, <m>P\implies (Q\land R)</m> being false means that <m>Q\land R</m> is false while <m>P</m> is true.
Note that <m>Q\land R</m> being false means that at least one of <m>Q</m> and <m>R</m> are false
</p>
<p>
Consider the second implication, <m>\big((\neg Q)\land R\big) \implies (\neg P)</m>, which is true.
Since <m>P</m> is true, the conclusion of this implication, <m>\neg P</m> is false. But this means that the hypothesis,
<m>(\neg Q)\land R</m> is false, by modus tollens.  More explicitly, if the hypothesis were true while the conclusion is false, then the implication is false,
but if the hypothesis and conclusion are both false, then the implication is true.
Therefore, at least one of <m>\neg Q</m> and <m>R</m> are false.
</p>
<p>
We have determined that at least one of <m>Q</m> and <m>R</m> are false, and at least one of <m>\neg Q</m> and <m>R</m> are false.
In order for both of these conditions to be satisfied, <m>R</m> must be false.
If <m>R</m> were true, then both <m>Q</m> and <m>\neg Q</m> would necessarily be false, which is impossible!
</p>
<p>
We cannot determine the truth value of <m>Q</m> from the information given.
While <m>P</m> must be true and <m>R</m> must be false, <m>Q</m> can be true or false. We show how you can verify this:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Assume <m>Q</m> is false, then <m>Q\land R</m> is false and <m>P</m> is true, so the first implication is false.
Similarly, <m>(\neg Q) \land R</m> is false, while <m>\neg P</m> is false, so the second implication is true.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Now assume Q is true, then <m>Q\land R</m> is false and <m>P</m> is true, so the first implication is false.
Similarly, <m>(\neg Q) \land R</m> is false, while <m>\neg P</m> is false, so the second implication is true.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>




<p>
Alternatively, we could determine the answer by analyzing the truth tables of the two implications.

</tabular>

<p>
The second and fourth rows are the only rows where the first implication is false, and the second true.
In both these rows, <m>P</m> is true and <m>R</m> is false, so the truth values of these statements are determined.
Since <m>Q</m> is true in the second row, but false in the fourth row, we cannot determine the truth value of <m>Q</m>.
Either <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is true, and <m>R</m> is false, or <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is false, and <m>R</m> is false.
</p>
</answer>
<solution>
<p>
<m>P</m> is true and <m>R</m> is false. The truth value of <m>Q</m> cannot be determined from the given information.
