<statement>
<p>
There is an old saying: "Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky at morning, sailors take warning." The phrase tells us that if the sky is red at night, tomorrow's weather will be good for sailing. However, if the sky is red in the morning, there will be a storm that day, and sailors should be prepared.
</p>
<p>
Assume that the following statement is true:
<md>
<mrow>
  \text{If the sky is red and it is morning, then sailors should take warning.}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
<p>
Now assume also that ...
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 the sky is red. What can we conclude?
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 the sky is red and it is morning. What can we conclude?
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 sailors should take warning. What can we conclude?
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 it is not true that (the sky is red and it is morning). That is, the sky is not red or it is not morning. What can we conclude?
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 sailors should not take warning. What can we conclude?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 We cannot conclude anything. We have not satisfied the hypothesis of the conditional statement.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We conclude that sailors should take warning by modus ponens.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We cannot conclude anything. If we did, we would be <q>affirming the consequent,</q> and this is a false deduction. There are many other things that could cause sailors to take warning, such as pirates or a group of hungry sharks.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We cannot conclude anything. If we did, we would be <q>denying the antecedent,</q> and this is a false deduction.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 We conclude that it is not true that (the sky is red and it is morning) by modus tollens.
