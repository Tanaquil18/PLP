<statement>
<p>
Indicate whether the following are true or false. Explain your answers.
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 If <m>x</m> is even, then <m>x\in \{2n : n\in \mathbb{N}\}</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>x</m> is prime, then <m>x= 2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>x\in \{3k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m> then <m>x\in \{6k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>x\in \{6k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m> then <m>x\in \{3k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>.
</p>

</ol>

</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 False. Recall that we can also read this statement as <q>whenever <m>x</m> is an even number, it is also twice a natural number .</q> Notice that the set in the conclusion is the set of positive even numbers, so taking a negative even number, such as <m>x=-2</m>, we see that there is no <m>n\in\mathbb N</m> such that <m>x= 2n</m>.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 False. The statement can also be read as <q>every prime number is odd,</q> but <m>2</m> is an even prime number, so the statement must be false.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 False. This statement can be read as <q>every multiple of <m>3</m> is a multiple of <m>6</m>.</q>  The number <m>3</m> is a multiple of <m>3</m> (in particular, <m>3=3\cdot 1</m>), but it is not a multiple of <m>6</m>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
 True. This statement can be read as <q>every multiple of <m>6</m> is a multiple of <m>3</m>.</q> Here is a brief proof of our claim:
</p>

<proof><p>
 Suppose that <m>x\in \{6k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>. By definition, we may write <m>x = 6k</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Factoring the <m>6</m> yields <m>x = 3(2k)</m>. Since <m>2k</m> is an integer, we have shown that we can write <m>x</m> as a multiple of <m>3</m>. Hence we may conclude that <m>x\in \{3k : k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>, as desired.
