<statement>
<p>
Let <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, <m>R</m>, and <m>S</m> be statements. Suppose that
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 <m>S</m> is true,
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
<q> <m> \big( R\lor(\neg P)\big) \implies \big(Q\land (\neg S)\big)</m></q> is true, and
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <q><m> P \iff \big(Q\lor (\neg S) \big) </m></q> is true.
</p></li>
</ul>
Determine the truth values of <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Is the conclusion of the implication true or false? What does that tell you?
</p>
</hint>
<answer>
<p>
Since <m>S</m> is true, <m>\neg S</m> is false, and consequently the conclusion of the implication, <m>Q\land (\neg S)</m>, is false.
But since the implication is true, its hypothesis <m> R\lor(\neg P)</m> must also be false. If the hypothesis were true while the
conclusion were false, then the implication would be false.
</p>
<p>
Since <m> R\lor(\neg P)</m> is false, both <m>R</m> and <m>\neg P</m> are false. So <m>R</m> is false while <m>P</m> is true.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we use that <m> P \iff \big(Q\lor (\neg S) \big) </m> is true. Since <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q\lor (\neg S) </m> must also be true.
But <m>\neg S</m> is false, so <m>Q</m> must be true.
</p>
<p>
We have deduced that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true while <m>R</m> is false.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, we could solve this question by analyzing the truth tables of the implication and biconditional. We only include the rows where <m>S</m> is true, since this is given in the question.

</tabular>

<p>
The only row in which the implication and biconditional are true is row 2, so we look at this row to discern the truth values of <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m>: <m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is true, and <m>R</m> is false.
</p>
</answer>
<solution>
<p>
<m>P</m> is true, <m>Q</m> is true, and <m>R</m> is false.
