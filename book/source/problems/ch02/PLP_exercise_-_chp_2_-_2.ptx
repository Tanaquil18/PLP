 If the moon is made of cheese, then every cat in this room is purple.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 True. A weekend consists of the days Saturday and Sunday, hence, if it is Saturday, we can conclude that it is the weekend.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 False. Since a weekend consists of Saturday and Sunday, knowing that it is a weekend is not enough to conclude that it is Saturday.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 True. The hypothesis is false, so we automatically conclude that the implication is true.

</li>
</ol>
