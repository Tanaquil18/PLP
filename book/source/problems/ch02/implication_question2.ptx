<statement>
<p>
In <xref ref="ch-contradictions"/>, we will prove that the following implication is true for <m>p=2</m>:
<md>
<mrow>
\text{If } p \text{ is prime, then } \sqrt{p} \text{ is irrational.}
</mrow>
</md>
In fact, this implication is true for any prime number <m>p</m>.
</p>
<p>
Write out the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of this implication.
Can you determine whether any of these are true or false statements from the fact that the original implication is true?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
Let <m>P=</m> <q><m>p</m> is prime</q> and <m>Q=</m> <q><m>\sqrt{p}</m> is irrational.</q>
<ul>
<li>
The contrapositive of <m>P\implies Q</m> is <m>\neg Q\implies \neg P</m>, or <q>If <m>\sqrt{p}</m> is rational, then <m>p</m> is not prime.</q>
</li>
<li>
The converse of <m>P\implies Q</m> is <m>Q\implies P</m>, or <q>If <m>\sqrt{p}</m> is irrational, then <m>p</m> is prime.</q>
</li>
<li>
The inverse of <m>P\implies Q</m> is <m>\neg P \implies \neg Q</m>, <q>If <m>p</m> is not prime, then <m>\sqrt{p}</m> is rational.</q>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Since the truth tables of the implication and its contrapositive are the same, the contrapositive is also a true statement.
Since the truth tables of the converse and inverse differ from that of the original implication, we cannot determine
whether or not the converse and inverse are true statements from the information provided
(although they are indeed false, as evidenced by the fact that <m>\sqrt{6}</m> is irrational;
this is something you could prove using the tools developed later on in this book).
