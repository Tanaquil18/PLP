<statement>
<p>
Let <m>m\in\mathbb{N}</m>. Then two true statements are:
<md>
<mrow>
\text{If }\amp m \text{ is odd, then } m^2 \text{ is odd.}
</mrow><mrow>
\text{If }\amp m \text{ is even, then } m^2 \text{ is divisible by 4.}
</mrow>
</md>
Construct the contrapositive of each implication to give a total of four different implications.
Which combinations can you chain together (so that the conclusion of the first is the hypothesis of the second), and what new implications do these combinations form?
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
Let <m>P=</m> <q><m>m^2</m> is even,</q> <m>Q=</m> <q><m>m</m> is even,</q> and <m>R=</m> <q><m>m^2</m> is divisible by 4.</q>
</p>
<p>
The statement  <q>If <m>m</m> is odd, then <m>m^2</m> is odd</q> converts to <m>(\neg Q)\implies (\neg P).</m>
Its contrapositive is <m>\neg(\neg P)\implies \neg(\neg Q)</m>, which is the same as <m>P\implies Q</m>.
In words, the contrapositive is <q>If <m>m^2</m> is even, then <m>m</m> is even.</q>
Since an implication and its contrapositive have the same truth table, and <m>(\neg Q)\implies (\neg P)</m> is true,
<m>P\implies Q</m> is also true.
</p>
<p>
The statement <q>If <m>m</m> is even, then <m>m^2</m> is divisible by 4</q> converts to <m>Q\implies R</m>.
Its contrapositive is <m>(\neg R)\implies (\neg Q)</m>, or <q>If <m>m^2</m> is not divisible by 4, then <m>m</m> is odd.</q>
</p>
<p>
We have the four distinct implications, <m> P\implies Q</m>, <m>(\neg Q)\implies (\neg P)</m>, <m> Q\implies R</m>, and <m>(\neg R)\implies (\neg Q)</m>.
</p>
<p>
Chaining the implications <m>P\implies Q</m> and <m>Q\implies R</m>, we end up with the implication <m>P\implies R</m>, or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<q>If <m>m^2</m> is even, then <m>m^2</m> is divisible by 4.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Chaining the implications <m>(\neg R)\implies (\neg Q)</m> and <m>(\neg Q)\implies (\neg P)</m>, we end up with the implication <m>(\neg R)\implies (\neg P)</m>, or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<q>If <m>m^2</m> is not divisible by 4, then <m>m^2</m> is odd.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that this implication is the contrapositive of the other implication we formed.
