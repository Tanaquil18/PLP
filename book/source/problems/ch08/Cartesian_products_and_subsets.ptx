<solution>
<proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
<p> We require two cases.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 <em>Case 1:</em> <m>C= \emptyset</m>.
    By the definition of the Cartesian product, an element of <m>A\times C</m> takes the form <m>(a,c)</m> where <m>a\in A</m> and <m>c\in C = \emptyset</m>. But by the definition of the empty set, no such <m>c</m> exists. Therefore the ordered pair <m>(a,c)</m> cannot exist, and we see that there are no elements in <m>A\times C</m>. Therefore, <m>A\times C = \emptyset</m>. We can similarly argue that <m>B\times C = \emptyset</m>. We conclude that
    <me>\emptyset = A\times C \subseteq B\times C = \emptyset.</me>
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <em>Case 2:</em> <m>C\neq \emptyset</m>.
    Suppose that <m>x\in A\times C</m>. Then by the definition of the Cartesian product, <m>x = (a,c)</m> for some elements <m>a\in A</m> and <m>c\in C</m>. Since <m>A\subseteq B</m>, we also have <m>a\in B</m>. Then by the definition of the Cartesian product, <m>x = (a,c) \in B\times C</m>. We conclude that <m>A\times C \subseteq B\times C.</m>
 </p></li>
</ul>
</p>
</proof>


<p>
  In order for (b) to be true, we claim that we require that <m>C\neq \emptyset</m>.
</p>
<proof><title>Proof of (b)</title>
  <p>
First, notice that if <m>C = \emptyset</m>, then by <em>Case 1</em> of the proof of part (a), we would have <m>A\times C = \emptyset = B\times C</m>. Thus, we must require that <m>C\neq \emptyset</m>.
</p>
<p>
Now, we repeat the argument of <em>Case 2</em> from part (a).
</p>
<p>
Suppose that <m>x\in A\times C</m>. Then by the definition of the Cartesian product, <m>x = (a,c)</m> for some elements <m>a\in A</m> and <m>c\in C</m>. Since <m>A\subset B</m>, we also have <m>a\in B</m>. Then by the definition of the Cartesian product, <m>x = (a,c) \in B\times C</m>. Therefore <m>A\times C \subseteq B\times C.</m>
</p>
<p>
It remains to show that <m>B\times C \not\subseteq A\times C</m>. Since <m>A\subset B</m>, there exists an element <m>b\in B</m> such that <m>b \not\in A</m>. Let <m>c\in C</m>, then by the definition of the Cartesian product, <m>(b, c)\in B\times C</m>. However, since <m>b\not\in A</m>, <m>(b, c)\not\in A\times C</m>. We conclude that <m>B\times C \not\subseteq A\times C</m>. Therefore,
<me>A\times C\subset B\times C,</me>
as required.
