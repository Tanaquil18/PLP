<statement>
<p>
Prove or disprove the following statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Let  <m>m,n \in\mathbb{Z}</m>. Then <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x}\subseteq \set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x}\cap\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x}</m>.
</p>
</blockquote>


</statement>
<answer>
<p>
We see that this is a `prove or disprove' question. This means that we need to figure out whether it is true or not.
</p>
<p>
The statement claims that every element of <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x}</m> is an element of <m> \set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x}</m> and <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x}</m>. In other words, every multiple of <m>mn</m> is a multiple of <m>m</m> and also a multiple of <m>n</m>. We can easily tell that this statement is true. So, we need to prove it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we should be extra careful around statements that we can <q>easily</q> decide are true. Sometimes they are very deceptive. As a general rule, we should avoid using words like <q>easily</q> when we do mathematics.

</answer>
<solution>

<proof><p>
  Let <m>m,n\in\mathbb Z</m>. Assume that <m>s\in \{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x\}</m>. Then we see that <m>mn\mid s</m> and thus, <m>s=mnk</m> for some <m>k\in\mathbb Z</m>.
  <ul>
<li>
<p>
 Now since <m>s = m(nk)</m> and <m>nk \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, we know that <m>m \mid s</m>.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Similarly, since <m>s=n(mk)</m> and <m>mk \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, we also know that <m>n \mid s</m>.
  </p></li>
</ul>
  Consequently  <m>s\in  \{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x\}</m> and <m>s\in  \{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x\}</m>.
  Since <m>s</m> is an element of both of those sets, it is an element of their intersection. Thus
<me>
  \{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x\}\subseteq \{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x\}\cap\{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x\}
</me>
as required.
</p></proof>
