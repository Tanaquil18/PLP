<statement>
<p>
Prove or disprove the following statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 If <m>m,n \in\mathbb{N}</m>,
 then
 <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x}\cap\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x}\subseteq \set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x}
 </m>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<answer>
<p>
We see that this is a <q>prove or disprove</q> question. This means that we need to figure out whether it is true or not.
</p>
<p>
The statement claims that every element that is both in the sets  <m> \set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : m\mid x}</m> and <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : n\mid x}</m> must be in <m>\set{x \in\mathbb{Z} : mn\mid  x}</m> as well. In other words, if a number is a multiple of <m>m</m> and also is a multiple of <m>n</m>, then it is also a multiple of <m>mn</m>. This statement doesn't really sound right since <m>m</m> can itself be a multiple of <m>n</m>, and thus, the hypothesis wouldn't give us any more information other than the number being a multiple of <m>m</m> (since it automatically becomes a multiple of <m>n</m> in that situation). This also suggests that we find a counterexample to this statement. Moreover, this suggest what kind of a counterexample would work. Let's see how we can create a counterexample.

<solution>

<proof><title>Disproof</title><p>
This statement is false. We see that if we take <m>m=n=2</m>, then
</p>
<p>
<m>\{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon mn\mid  x\}=\set{x\in\mathbb{Z}\colon 4\mid x}</m>, and <m>\{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon m\mid  x\}\cap\{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon n\mid  x\}=\{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon 2\mid  x\}</m>. Thus, since <m>2\in \{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon 2\mid  x\}</m>, but <m>2\notin \{x \in\mathbb{Z} \colon 4\mid  x\}</m>, we see that the statement is false.
