<statement>
<p>
Let <m>R</m> be a symmetric and transitive relation on a set <m>A</m>.
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 Show that <m>R</m> is not necessarily reflexive.
</p>


</li>
<li>
<p>
 Suppose that for every <m>a \in A</m>, there exists <m>b \in A</m> such that <m>a \rel b</m>. Prove that <m>R</m> is
reflexive.
</p>


</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
For part (a), try looking at examples of relations on a small set, like <m>A=\{1,2,3\}</m>.
</p>
</hint>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 Take <m>A=\set{1,2,3}</m> and take the relation <m>R=\set{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)}</m>. Then <m>R</m> is a symmetric and transitive relation, but it's not reflexive, since <m>3\in A</m> but <m>(3,3)\not\in R</m>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<proof><title>Proof of (b)</title>
<p>
Assume that  for all  <m>a \in A</m>, there exists <m>b \in A</m> such that <m>a \rel b</m>. Let <m>x\in A</m> be arbitrary.
Then, by the assumption, there is some <m>y\in\ A</m> such that <m>x\rel y</m>. Since <m>R</m> is symmetric, we see that <m>y\rel x</m>. Moreover, since <m>R</m> is transitive and <m>x\rel y</m> and <m>y \rel x</m>, we see <m>x\rel x</m>. As <m>x</m> was arbitrary, <m>R</m> is reflexive.
