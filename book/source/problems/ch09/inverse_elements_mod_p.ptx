 We want to show that <m>nk\equiv1\mod{p}</m>. Then by definition, we want to show that <m>p\mid nk-1</m>, that is, there's some <m>\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>p\ell=nk-1</m>. Let's rewrite this equation as <m>1=kn+(-\ell)p</m>.
This equation may look familiar from Bézout's identity, which tells us that if <m>a,b\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, with at least one of them non-zero, then there are some <m>x,y\in\mathbb{Z}</m> so that <m>ax+by=\gcd(a,b)</m>.
In order to show that there is some <m>\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m> so that <m>1=kn+(-\ell)p</m>, it suffices, by Bézout's identity, to show that <m>\gcd(n,p)=1</m>.
</p>
<p>
To show that <m>\gcd(n,p)=1</m>, we'll use the hypothesis that <m>n\not\equiv0\mod{p}</m>. By definition, this means that <m>p\nmid (n-0)</m>, so <m>p\nmid n</m>. Since <m>p</m> is prime, its only divisors are <m>1</m> and <m>p</m>. Since <m>p</m> isn't a divisor of <m>n</m>, we must have <m>\gcd(n,p)=1</m>.
</p>
<p>
Now we can write the proof.

</li>
<li>
<p>
 Let's try to find such an <m>n</m> when <m>p</m> is not prime; we'll use <m>p=4</m> since it is a small composite number. We need to choose <m>n</m> so that <m>\gcd(n,p)\neq1</m>; if <m>n</m> is such that <m>\gcd(n,p)=1</m>, then we could use Bézout's identity as in part (a) to find some <m>k</m> with <m>nk\equiv1\mod{p}</m>.
So let's try <m>n=2</m>. We need to check that <m>nk\not\equiv1\pmod{4}</m> for each <m>k\in\set{0,1,2,3}</m>, since these represent all equivalence classes mod <m>4</m>. We have
<me> 2\cdot0\equiv0\pmod{4}, \quad 2\cdot1\equiv2\pmod{4}, \quad 2\cdot2\equiv0\pmod{4}, \quad 2\cdot3\equiv2\pmod{4}, </me>
so there is no <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m> with <m>2k\equiv1\mod{4}</m>.
</p>
<p>
We chose <m>n=2</m> because then <m>nk</m> is always an even number, however in order to have <m>nk \equiv 1 \mod{4}</m>, we need <m>nk</m> to be odd. Since a number cannot be even and odd at the same time, that cannot happen.

<solution>
<proof><title>Proof of (a)</title>
<p>
Let <m>p</m> be a prime number, and suppose that <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m> is such that <m>n\not\equiv0\mod{p}</m>.  Then <m>p\nmid (n-0)</m>, so <m>p\nmid n</m>. Since <m>p</m> is prime, its only divisors are <m>1</m> and <m>p</m>, and as <m>p</m> isn't a divisor of <m>n</m>, we have <m>\gcd(n,p)=1</m>.
Then, by Bézout's identity, there are some <m>k,\ell\in\mathbb{Z}</m> so that <m>nk+\ell p=1</m>. Rearranging, we have <m>\ell p=1-nk</m>, and so <m>p\mid (1-nk)</m>. Then, by definition, <m>nk\equiv 1\mod{p}</m>.
</p>
</proof>

<p>For (b), take <m>p=4</m> and set <m>n=2</m>. Then for any <m>k</m>, we know that <m>nk</m> is even, and so <m>nk-1</m> is odd. Since <m>nk-1</m> is odd it is not divisible by 4. Thus <m>nk \not\equiv 1 \mod{4}</m>.
