<statement>
<p>
Prove or disprove the following statements:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 If <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are two equivalence relations on a set <m>A</m>, then <m>R\cup S</m> is also an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are two equivalence relations on a set <m>A</m>, then <m>R\cap S</m> is also an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Try looking at examples of relations on a small set, like <m>A=\{1,2,3\}</m>.
</p>
</hint>
<solution>
<p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li>
<p>
 This statement is false.
</p>

<proof><p>
As a counterexample,  take <m>A=\set{1,2,3}</m> and the relations
<me>
R=\set{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1)}
\text{ and }
S=\set{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,3),(3,1)}.
</me>
Note that <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are equivalence relations. However,
<me> R\cup S=\set{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1)} </me>
 is not an equivalence relation since it is not transitive; <m>(2,1),(1,3)\in R\cup S</m>, but <m>(2,3)\notin R\cup S</m>.
</p></proof>

</li>
<li>
<p>
 This statement is true.
</p>

<proof><p>
We need to show that <m>R\cap S</m> is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Reflexive: Let <m>a\in A</m>. Since <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are reflexive, <m>(a,a)\in R</m> and <m>(a,a)\in S</m>. But then <m>(a,a)\in R\cap S</m>, so <m>R\cap S</m> is reflexive.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Symmetric: Suppose <m>(a,b)\in R\cap S</m>. Then <m>(a,b)\in R</m> and <m>(a,b)\in S</m> by definition of the intersection. Since <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are symmetric, <m>(b,a)\in R</m> and <m>(b,a)\in S</m>.
Thus <m>(b,a)\in R\cap S</m>, and so <m>R\cap S</m> is symmetric.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Transitive: Suppose <m>(a,b)\in R\cap S</m> and <m>(b,c)\in R\cap S</m>. Then <m>(a,b),(b,c)\in R</m> and <m>(a,b),(b,c)\in S</m>, by definition of the intersection. Since <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are transitive, <m>(a,c)\in R</m> and <m>(a,c)\in S</m>.
Hence <m>(a,c)\in R\cap S</m>, and <m>R\cap S</m> is transitive.
</p></li>
</ul>
