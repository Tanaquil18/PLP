<statement>
<p>
Let <m>A</m> be a non-empty set and <m>P\subseteq \mathcal P(A)</m> and <m>Q\subseteq \mathcal P(A)</m> partitions of <m>A</m>. Prove that the set <m>R</m> defined as
<md>
<mrow>
    R=\{S\cap T : S\in P,\ T\in Q\}- \{\emptyset\}
</mrow>
</md>
is also a partition of <m>A</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Remember that every element of the set <m>R</m> is the intersection of two elements of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>. Also, read the definition of partitions carefully.

<solution>

<proof><p>
  Let <m>A,P,Q,R</m> be as given in the statement of the problem. Then to show that <m>R</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>, we need to show that
<md>
<mrow>
\bigcup_{X\in R}X=A
</mrow>
</md>
and
<md>
<mrow>
 (U_1, U_2\in R, U_1\neq U_2)\implies (U_1\cap U_2=\emptyset).
</mrow>
</md>
We prove each of these in turn.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
  To prove the set equality we need to show that each side is included in the other. One of these inclusions is straight-forward, since if <m>X\in R</m>, then, by definition of <m>R</m>, <m>X\subseteq A</m>. Therefore, we see that <m>\bigcup_{X\in R}X\subseteq A</m>.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we just need to show that <m>A\subseteq \bigcup_{X\in R}X</m>.
Let <m>x\in A</m>.
Since <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are partitions of <m>A</m>, there exists <m>S\in P</m> and <m>T\in Q</m> such that <m>x\in S</m> and <m>x\in T</m>.
This entails that <m>x\in S\cap T</m> and <m>S\cap T\in R</m>.
Therefore <m>x\in \bigcup_{X\in R}X</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 To show the second property of partitions let <m>U_1,U_2\in R</m>.
By definition <m>U_1=S_1\cap T_1</m> for some <m>S_1\in P</m> and <m>T_1\in Q</m>.
Similarly, <m>U_2 = S_2 \cap T_2</m> for some <m>S_2 \in P</m> and <m>T_2 \in Q</m>.
</p>
<p>
We can prove the contrapositive of the implication. Assume that <m>U_1 \cap U_2 \neq \emptyset</m>. Hence there is some <m>x \in U_1 \cap U_2</m>. Since <m>x \in U_1</m> this implies that <m>x \in S_1 \cap T_1</m>, and since <m>x \in U_2</m> we know that <m>x \in S_2 \cap T_2</m>. Thus <m>x</m> is in all of <m>S_1, S_2, T_1, T_2</m>.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Since <m>x \in S_1</m> and <m>x \in S_2</m>, it follows that <m>x \in S_1 \cap S_2</m>. Thus, since <m>S_1, S_2</m> are parts of a partition, we have <m>S_1 = S_2</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Similarly, since <m>x \in T_1</m> and <m>x \in T_2</m>, we know that <m>T_1 = T_2</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
Thus we must have <m>U_1 = S_1 \cap T_1 = S_2 \cap T_2 = U_2</m>. Hence when <m>U_1 \cap U_2 \neq \emptyset</m> it follows that <m>U_1 = U_2</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
In the end, <m>R</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.
