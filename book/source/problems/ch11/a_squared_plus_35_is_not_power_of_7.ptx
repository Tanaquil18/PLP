We'll prove this by contradiction by first assuming that there are some <m>a,n\in\mathbb N</m> satisfying the equation.
Writing <m>a^2=7^n-35</m>, we can show that <m>a^2</m> is divisible by <m>7</m>. By Euclid's lemma, this implies that <m>7\mid a</m>.
Then <m>7^2\mid a^2</m>. Notice that <m>7\mid 35</m>, but <m>7^2\nmid 35</m>. If we also had <m>7^2\mid 7^n</m>, then that would imply <m>7^2</m> divides <m>35=7^n-a^2</m>, which is a contradiction.
So we have a contradiction in the case <m>n\geq 2</m>. Now we just need to show that the case <m>n=1</m> also leads to a contradiction. In this case, we have the equation <m>a^2+35=7</m>. This is imposible, since <m>a^2+35\geq 35</m>.

<solution>

<proof><p>
Assume for a contradiction that there exist <m>a,n\in\mathbb N</m> such that <m>a^2 + 35 = 7^n</m>.
 Then we can write <m>a^2=7(7^{n-1}-5)</m>, and as <m>n\in\mathbb N</m>, we have that <m>7^{n-1}-5\in\mathbb Z</m>; thus <m>7\mid a^2</m>. Since <m>7</m> is prime, by Euclid's lemma, we have <m>7\mid a</m>.
 Thus, <m>a=7m</m> for some <m>m\in\mathbb Z</m>. Plugging this into the original equation, we obtain
  <me> 7^2m^2+35=7^n. </me>
 Now, we have two cases for <m>n</m>, either <m>n=1</m> or <m>n \geq 2</m>.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 If <m>n=1</m>, then the equation becomes <m>7^2m^2+35=7</m>. But <m>7^2m^2+35\geq 35</m>, so this is a contradiction.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 Now assume that <m>n\geq 2</m>. Rewrite the equation as
<me> 7^2(7^{n-2}-m^2)=7^n-7m^2=35. </me>
Since <m>n-2\geq0</m>, we have <m>7^{n-2}-m^2\in\mathbb Z</m>, implying that <m>7^2\mid 35</m>. This is a contradiction.
</p></li>
</ul>
Either case leads to a contradiction, and thus are no <m>a,n\in\mathbb N</m> such that <m>a^2 + 35 = 7^n.</m>
</p></proof>
