<statement>
<p>
Prove that if <m>k</m> is a positive integer and <m>\sqrt{k}</m>  is not an integer, then <m>\sqrt{k}</m> is irrational.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Prove this by contradiction, but negate the statement carefully. Then, to get more information, Bézout's identity could be very useful.

<solution>

<proof><p>
Assume for a contradiction that <m>k</m> is a positive integer, <m>\sqrt{k}</m> is not an integer, but that <m>\sqrt k</m> is rational. Then we see that <m>\sqrt k=\dfrac{a}{b}</m> for some <m>a\in\mathbb Z</m> and <m>b\in\mathbb N</m>, where <m>\gcd(a,b)=1</m>.  This gives us two equations:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 By rearranging the expression for <m>\sqrt{k}</m> we have
  <me>kb^2 = a^2.</me>
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 At the same time, since <m>\gcd(a,b)=1</m>, Bézout's identity implies that there exists integers <m>x,y</m> so that
  <me>
    ax +by =1.
  </me>
</p></li>
</ul>
We can link these two equations together by multiplying the the second by <m>a</m> and then substituing in the first gives
<me>
  kb^2x + aby = a.
</me>
Factoring this then gives
<me>
  b (kbx + ay) = a
</me>
and since <m>kbx + ay \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, this implies that <m>b \mid a</m>.
</p>
<p>
We know that <m>\gcd(a,b)=1</m> and so if <m>b \mid a</m>, we must have that <m>b=1</m>. This, in turn, implies that we can write <m>\sqrt{k} = \frac{a}{b} = a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. This contradicts our assumption that <m>k</m> is not an integer.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the statement is true.
