<statement>
<p>
Let <m>r,x\in\mathbb{R}</m>, with <m>r\neq0</m>. Prove by contradiction that if <m>r</m> is rational and <m>x</m> is irrational, then <m>rx</m> must be irrational.
</p>
</statement>

<answer>
<p>
Let's assume the conclusion is false, that is, that <m>rx</m> is rational. Then we can write <m>rx=p/q</m> and <m>r=m/n</m> for integers <m>p,q,m,n</m>.
Using this, we can show that <m>x</m> is rational, which is a contradiction. However, when we write the proof up, we need to be careful to always show that our denominators are non-zero

<solution>

<proof><p>
Let <m>r,x\in\mathbb{R}</m> with <m>r\neq0</m>. Suppose that <m>r</m> is rational and <m>x</m> is irrational. Assume, toward a contradiction, that <m>rx\in\mathbb{Q}</m>.
Then there are integers <m>p,q</m>, with <m>q</m> non-zero, such that <m>rx=p/q</m>.
As <m>r\neq0</m> and rational, there are non-zero integers <m>m,n</m> such that <m>r=m/n</m>.
Then 
<me> \frac{p}{q}=rx=\frac{m}{n}x, </me>
and since <m>m\neq0</m> we have
<me> x=\frac{pn}{qm}. </me>
But <m>pn,qm\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>qm\neq0</m>, which contradicts the fact that <m>x</m> is irrational. Thus <m>x\not\in\mathbb{Q}</m>, as required.
