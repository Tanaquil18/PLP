<solution>

<proof><p>
Assume for a contradiction that <m>x</m> is a rational number. This means that we can write <m>x=\dfrac{m}{n}</m>, where <m>m \in\mathbb Z</m>, <m>n\in\mathbb N</m>, where <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>. Then, plugging this into the equation, we get
 <me> \dfrac{m^7}{n^7}+5\dfrac{m^2}{n^2}-3=0. </me>
Then multiplying both sides by <m>n^7</m> we get
<me> m^7+5m^2n^5-3n^7=0. </me>
Since, by assumption, this is satisfied by <m>m,n</m>, it must also be satisfied modulo 2. It becomes:
<me>
  m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 0 \pmod 2
</me>
There are four possibilities depending on the parity of <m>m,n</m>: both even, both odd, or different parities,
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 both even: This implies that <m>2 \mid m</m> and <m>2 \mid n</m> which contradicts our assumption that <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>. Thus this cannot happen.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 both odd: in this case <m>m \equiv 1 \pmod 2, n \equiv 1 \pmod 2</m>, but then
  <me>
    m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 3 \equiv 1 \pmod 2
  </me>
  But this cannot happen since <m>m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 0 \pmod 2</m>, and <m>1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod 2</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>m</m> even and <m>n</m> odd: In this case <m>m \equiv 0 \pmod 2</m> and <m>n \equiv 1 \pmod 2</m> and so
  <me>
    m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 1 \pmod 2
  </me>
  Again, this cannot happen since <m>m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 0 \pmod 2</m>.
  </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>m</m> odd and <m>n</m> even: Now <m>m \equiv 1 \pmod 2</m> and <m>n \equiv 0 \pmod 2</m> and so
  <me>
    m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 1 \pmod 2
  </me>
  This cannot happen since <m>m^7 + m^2n^5 + n^7 \equiv 0 \pmod 2</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
This gives us a contradiction since there is no integer solution to this equation modulo 2.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, any real solution of the equation <m>x^7 + 5x^2 - 3 = 0</m> is irrational.
