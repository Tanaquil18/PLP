<statement>
<p>
Prove that there is no integer <m>a</m> that simulataneously satisfies
<me>
  a \equiv 2 \mod 6 \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  a \equiv 7 \mod 9.
</me>
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
If <m>a</m> were to satisfy both congruences, then we get 2 equations. Combining them helps.

<answer>
<p>
Proof by contradiction can be a useful tool for proving statements where we want to show the <em>non-existence</em> of an object satisfying certain conditions. This is because when we assume for a contradiction that such an object exists, then we would have some structure we can work with and, hopefully, get a contradiction with our prior assumptions or knowledge.

</answer>
<solution>

<proof>
<p>
Assume for a contradiction that such an integer <m>a</m> exists. Then the first congruence implies that <m>a=6k+2</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Similarly, the second congruence implies that <m>a=9\ell+7</m> for some integer <m>\ell</m>. Thus we have
<me>
6k+2 = 9\ell+7.
</me>
We can rewrite this as
<me>
6k-9\ell=3(2k-3\ell) = 5.
</me>
Therefore, since <m>2k+3\ell\in\mathbb Z</m>, we conclude that <m>3 \mid 5</m>, which is a contradiction.
</p>
<p>
Hence, there is no integer <m>a</m> so that <m>a \equiv 2 \mod 6</m> and <m>a \equiv 7 \mod 9</m>.
</p></proof>
