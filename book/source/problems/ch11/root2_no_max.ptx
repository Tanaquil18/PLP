<statement>
<p>
Consider the subset of rational numbers
<me>
  A = \set{x \in \mathbb{Q} \st x \leq \sqrt{2}}
</me>
Prove that it does not have a maximum.
</p>
<p>
See also <xref ref="ex_sup_q1"/> and <xref ref="ex_sup_q2"/>.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
If <m>A</m> were to have a maximum, what is the difference between <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and that? It is not a rational number, but how can we use it to make a rational number that is still in <m>A</m>?
</p>
</hint>
<solution>

<proof><p>
  Assume, to the contrary, that this set does have a maxium. Then we can write that maximum as
  <m> \frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}</m>. Since <m>\sqrt{2} \not\in \mathbb{Q}</m>, we must have that
  <me>
    \sqrt{2} - \frac{a}{b} = \delta \gt 0.
  </me>
  Now let <m>n = \left\lceil \frac{1}{\delta} \right\rceil</m>. Then
  <me>
    0 \lt \frac{1}{n} \lt \delta = \sqrt{2}-\frac{a}{b}
  </me>
  and so
  <me>
    \frac{a}{b} \lt \frac{a}{b}+\frac{1}{n} \lt \sqrt{2}
  </me>
  Thus <m>\frac{a}{b}+\frac{1}{n} </m> is a rational number larger than <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> and smaller than <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, which contradicts our assumption that the maximum of <m>A</m> was <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>.
</p>
<p>
  Hence the set has no maximum.
