Recall the <em>Intermediate Value Theorem:</em>
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Let <m>g: U \to \mathbb{R}</m> where <m>U\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m>. Suppose <m>g</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]\subseteq U</m>, and
<me>f(a) \geq c \geq f(b) \quad \text{  OR } \quad f(a) \leq c \leq f(b),</me> then there exists <m>x_0\in [a,b]</m> such that <m>g(x_0) = c</m>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Let <m>f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}</m> be a continuous, bijective function. Using the Intermediate Value Theorem, prove that <m>f</m> is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. See <xref ref="ex_comp_inc_decr"/> for the definitions of strictly increasing and decreasing.
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
What would happen if the function weren't strictly increasing or decreasing?
</p>
</hint>
<solution>

<proof><p>
    Let <m>f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}</m> be a continuous, bijective function.
</p>
<p>
    By way of contradiction, assume that <m>f</m> is neither strictly increasing, nor strictly decreasing.
</p>
<p>
Then there exists <m>x_1, x_2, x_3\in \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>x_1 \lt x_2 \lt x_3</m> such that
<ol marker="(1)">
<li>
<p>
 <m>f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)</m> and <m>f(x_3)\leq f(x_2)</m> (the function increases and then decreases). Or,
        </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 <m>f(x_1)\geq f(x_2)</m> and <m>f(x_3) \geq f(x_2)</m> (the function decreases and then increases).
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    First, we consider case (1). In this case, the function increases and then decreases, but we do not have information about how <m>f(x_1)</m> compares to <m>f(x_3)</m>. This gives us two further sub-cases.
    <ol marker="(i)">
<li>
<p>
 Suppose <m>f(x_1)\leq f(x_3)</m>. We combine this with the inequalities from (1) to find
        <me>f(x_1)\leq f(x_3)\leq f(x_2).</me>
        We can regard <m>f(x_3)</m> as the value <m>c</m> in the statement of the Intermediate Value Theorem. Since <m>f</m> is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists <m>x_0\in [x_1, x_2]</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = f(x_3)</m>. Because <m>x_0 \leq x_2  \lt  x_3</m>, <m>x_0 \neq x_3</m>. This contradicts the assumption that <m>f</m> is injective.
        </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Suppose <m>f(x_3)\leq f(x_1)</m>. Combining this with the inequalities from (1) yields
        <me>f(x_3)\leq f(x_1)\leq f(x_2).</me>
        We can now regard <m>f(x_1)</m> as the value <m>c</m> in the statement of the Intermediate Value Theorem. Since <m>f</m> is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there exists <m>x_0\in [x_2, x_3]</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = f(x_1)</m>. Because <m>x_1  \lt x_2 \leq x_0</m>, <m>x_1 \neq x_0</m> and we find that <m>f</m> is not injective.
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    The argument is similar for case (2). We break into two further sub-cases which compares the value of <m>f(x_1)</m> with <m>f(x_3)</m>.
    <ol marker="(i)">
<li>
<p>
 Suppose <m>f(x_1)\leq f(x_3)</m>. Then the inequalities from (2) tell us
        <me>f(x_2)\leq f(x_1)\leq f(x_3).</me>
        We regard <m>f(x_1)</m> as the value <m>c</m> in the statement of the Intermediate Value Theorem. Since <m>f</m> is continuous,  the Intermediate Value Theorem says there exists <m>x_0\in [x_2, x_3]</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = f(x_1)</m>. Notice that <m>x_1 \lt  x_2 \leq x_0</m>, so <m>x_1 \neq x_0</m>. We conclude that <m>f</m> is not injective.
        </p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Finally, suppose <m>f(x_3)\leq f(x_1)</m>.  <m>f</m> is continuous, and from (2) we know that <me>f(x_2)\leq f(x_3)\leq f(x_1).</me>
        We regard <m>f(x_3)</m> as the value <m>c</m> in the statement of the Intermediate Value Theorem. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists <m>x_0\in [x_1, x_2]</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = f(x_3)</m>. Because <m>x_3 \gt  x_2 \geq  x_0</m>, we see that <m>x_3\neq x_0</m>, so <m>f</m> is not injective.
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
    In each of the four cases, we reach the conclusion that <m>f</m> is not injective, contradicting our assumption that <m>f</m> is bijective.
</p>
<p>
    We conclude that <m>f</m> must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing
    </p></proof>
