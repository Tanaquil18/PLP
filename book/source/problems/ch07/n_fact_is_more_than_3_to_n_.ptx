<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>n\geq 7</m>. Prove that <m>n!  \gt  3^n</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<!-- <hint></hint> -->

<solution>

<proof><p>
We prove the result by induction. As a base case, take <m>n = 7</m>. We see that
<me>7! = 7\cdot 6 \cdots 3\cdot 2 = 5040  \gt  2187 = 3^7,</me>
hence, our base case is true.
</p>
<p>
Now, we assume that the statement is true for an arbitrary <m>n=k\in \mathbb{N}</m>, and we aim to show the statement for <m>n=k+1</m>. We factor,
<md>
<mrow>
    (k+1)!  \amp = (k+1) \cdot k!
    </mrow><intertext>By the inductive hypothesis <m>k!  \gt  3^k</m>, so we see</intertext><mrow>
     \amp  \gt  (k+1) \cdot 3^k
    </mrow><intertext>Since <m>k \geq 7</m>, we certainly have <m>k+1 \geq 8  \gt  3</m>, therefore</intertext><mrow>
     \amp  \gt  3 \cdot 3^k
</mrow><mrow>
     \amp = 3^{k+1}
</mrow>
</md>
So the inductive step holds.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>n!  \gt  3^n</m> for any <m>n\geq 7</m>.
