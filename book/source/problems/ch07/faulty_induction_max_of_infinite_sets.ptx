<statement>
<p>
Determine why the proposed proof of the following statement is incorrect:
</p>
<p>
Every non-empty subset <m>A</m> of the natural numbers has a maximum element.  That is, there is some <m>a\in A</m> such that <m>b\leq a</m> for all <m>b\in A</m>.
</p>

<proof><title>Faulty proof</title>
<p>
Let <m>A\subseteq\mathbb{N}</m> be non-empty. We proceed with induction on <m>|A|</m>.
</p>
<p>
If <m>|A|=1</m>, then the single element of <m>A</m> is its maximum.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose that <m>|A|=n+1</m> for some <m>n\geq1</m>, and that any subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> of size <m>n</m> has a maximum element.
Choose some <m>a\in A</m>, and let <m>B=A\setminus\{a\}</m>. Then <m>B\subseteq\mathbb{N}</m>, and <m>|B|=n</m>. By the inductive hypothesis, <m>B</m> has a maximum element, say <m>b</m>.
Therefore <m>c\leq b</m> for all <m>c\in A\setminus\{a\}</m>. If <m>a\leq b</m> as well, then <m>b</m> is the maximum element of <m>A</m>.
If <m>b\leq a</m>, then <m>c\leq b\leq a</m> for all <m>c\in A\setminus\{a\}</m>. Therefore <m>a</m> is the maximum element of <m>A</m>.
</p>
<p>
Taking <m>n\to\infty</m>, we see that any non-empty <m>A\subset\mathbb{N}</m> has a maximum.
</p></proof>

</statement>

<solution>
<p>
When we prove a statement, say <m>P(n)</m>, by induction, we prove the statement for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
Even though <m>n</m> can be as large as we like, it must always be a finite number. We can't actually set <m>n</m> to infinity.
</p>
<p>
The proposed proof actually shows that if <m>A\subseteq\mathbb{N}</m> and <m>|A|=n</m> for some <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, then <m>A</m> has a maximum element.
So, we have shown that if <m>A</m> is a non-empty subset of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> with a finite number of elements, then <m>A</m> has a maximum element.
This is not true if <m>A</m> has infinitely many elements. For example, if <m>A=\mathbb{N}</m>, then <m>A</m> does not have a maximum.
