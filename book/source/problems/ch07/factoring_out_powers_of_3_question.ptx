<statement>
<p>
Show that every natural number, <m>n</m>, can be written as <me> n=3^ma, </me> where <m>m\in\mathbb Z</m> such that <m>m\geq 0</m>, <m>a\in\mathbb N</m> and <m>3\nmid a</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<answer>
<p>
This question tell us that from a natural number <m>n</m>, we can divide out the the biggest possible power of <m>3</m>, say <m>3^m</m>, so that  <m>3\nmid \left( \frac{n}{3^m} \right)</m>. Since this is a statement that should hold for all natural numbers, induction may be useful method to use. But, because of the nature of the problem, i.e. since we are trying to factor out as many powers of <m>3</m> as possible, we see that it may be hard to get from <m>n=k</m> to <m>n=k+1</m>, but it may be easier to get from <m>n=\frac{(k+1)}{3}</m> to <m>n=k+1</m> assuming that <m>\frac{(k+1)}{3}\in\mathbb Z</m>.  This suggests that we may need to use strong induction rather than regular induction.

</answer>
<solution>

<proof><p>
 We are going to use strong induction on <m>a</m>.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Base case:</em> We see that this statement is true for <m>n=1</m> since we can take <m>m=0</m> and <m>3\nmid 1</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Inductive step:</em> Assume that the statement is true for all  <m>1\leq \ell \leq k</m>.
</p>
<p>
Then for <m>n=k+1</m> we have two cases.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 <em>Case 1:</em> <m>3\nmid n</m>. In this case, we can take <m>m=0, a=n</m>, that is <m>n = 3^0  n</m>. Thus, the statement is true.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 <em>Case 2:</em> <m>3\mid n</m>. Then, we know that <m>n=3b</m> for some <m>b\in\mathbb N</m>. Moreover, we see that <m>b \lt k+1</m>, and so <m>b \leq k</m>. Thus, by inductive hypothesis, we see that
<me>
  b=3^{m} a,
</me> for some <m>m,a \in\mathbb N</m> with <m>3 \nmid a </m>.
Hence
<me>
  n = 3b = 3^{m+1}a
</me>
And since <m>3 \nmid a</m>, the statement is true for <m>n=k + s1</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
So the inductive hypothesis holds for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
Therefore the statement is true for all <m>n\in\mathbb N</m>.
</p>
