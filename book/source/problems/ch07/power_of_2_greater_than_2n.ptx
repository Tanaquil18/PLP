<answer>
<p>
We need to prove the statement by induction. Let's take a look at the base case and the inductive step.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
 Base case: <m>n=1</m>. Then <m>2^n=2= 2n</m>, so <m>2^n\geq 2n</m>.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
 Inductive step: Suppose that the inequality holds for <m>n=k</m>, so that <m>2^k\geq 2k</m>. We need to show that
<m>2^{k+1}\geq 2(k+1)</m>.
</p>
<p>
Note that if we multiply <m>2^k\geq 2k</m> by <m>2</m>, we'll end up with <m>2^{k+1}</m> on the right-hand side,
which is the right-hand side of the inequality we want to show. So, let's do that to obtain <m>2^{k+1}\geq 4k</m>.
</p>
<p>
Now, we just need to show that <m>4k\geq 2(k+1)</m>, and then we'll have <m>2^{k+1}\geq 2(k+1)</m>, as desired.
Let's try to simplify the inequality <m>4k\geq 2(k+1)</m> to see why it may be true. Rewrite the inequality as
<me> 4k\geq 2k+2. </me>
Subtracting <m>2k</m> from both sides of the inequality, we have <m>2k\geq 2</m>, which after dividing by <m>2</m>, gives <m>k\geq1</m>.
But we know that <m>k\geq1</m>, since <m>k\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
</p>
<p>
We can reverse all of these steps to show that <m>k\geq 1</m> implies <m>4k\geq 2(k+1)</m>.
When we write up the formal proof, it's important to start with what we know, namely, that <m>k\geq 1</m>, in order to show the desired inequality, that <m>4k\geq 2(k+1)</m>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Now we're ready to write up the proof.

</answer>

<solution>
  <proof>
<p>
Let <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>. We proceed with induction on <m>n</m>.
For the base case, suppose <m>n=1</m>. Since <m>2^1=2\cdot 1</m>, we have <m>2^n\geq 2n</m>.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose that the statement is true for <m>n=k</m>; that is, <m>2^k\geq 2k</m>. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by <m>2</m>, we have
<m>2^{k+1}\geq 4k</m>.
Rewrite this inequality as <m>2^{k+1}\geq 2k+2k</m>.  Since <m>k\geq 1</m>, we have <m>2k\geq 2</m>, and so
<me> 2^{k+1}\geq 2k+2k\geq 2k+2=2(k+1) </me>
and thus the result is established for <m>n=k+1</m>. By induction, <m>2^n\geq 2n</m> holds for any <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
