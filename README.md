## About

This is the source repository for 
"PLP - An introduction to mathematical proof"
a [free](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) web- and pdf- textbook for a first undergraduate course in mathematical proof. 

It is written by [Seckin Demirbas](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~s.demirbas/) & [Andrew Rechnitzer](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/front_page.html). A very large fraction of the exercises and solutions were contributed by  [Hannah Kohut](https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/2920) and [Charlotte Trainor](https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/2576) with funding from UBC's [OER fund](https://oerfund.open.ubc.ca/) and also the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.ubc.ca/).

The text grew out of our lecture notes for [Mathematics 220](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/courses.cfm?page=code&code=MATH#220) at UBC. Those notes were written in LaTeX but as we started to transform them into this text we translated them into [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/). Many thanks to [Rob Beezer](http://buzzard.ups.edu/) and the [pretext community](https://groups.google.com/g/pretext-support) for all their help along the way.



## Build instructions

The source can be compiled into either a website or latex using the [pretext-cli](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/processing-CLI.html). Instructions coming soon.
