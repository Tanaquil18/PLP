# Weekly worksheets for a 13 week course

The authors have used the PLP text to teach a 13 week "first course in
mathematical proof" for 2nd year undergraduates.  For each week we
direct students to read sections of the text, and watch pre-recorded
videos. Then, during face-to-face class time, we do a mixture of
lecture and small group work on question-sheets. These question-sheets
are given below. We want to note that some, if not all, of the
questions in these worksheets are already in the book. This is a
selection of questions to go along with the course.  We also added the
specific moments during a week’s material to watch the following
video(s).

Each worksheet has about 2-3 questions per 50 minute lecture depending
on the difficulty of the problems. Almost every question has a hint
that can be shared with the students. This gives ample opportunities
to let students work alone or in groups, work diligently on
scratchwork, and outline the proof. Having enough time to guide
students to think more strategically and work on their scratchwork
before they write the proof helps them get better at approaching
mathematical problems later.

Finally, we want to mention that these question-sheets are compressed
to 12 weeks since we usually have a midterm (some time after we cover
‘induction’) and couple breaks that take about a week's worth of
material.
